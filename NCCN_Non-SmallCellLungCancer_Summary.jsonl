While the testing process may be technically easier on a resection specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing for this indication. NSCL-H 4 of 8 • ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) Gene Rearrangements ▸ Diamond 2 added: Molecular testing for ALK rearrangement mutations should be performed when TKI therapy is a consideration for NSCLC stage IB–IIIB. While the testing process may be technically easier on a resection specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing for this indication. NSCL-H 6 of 8 • Section added for HER2 protein overexpression: HER2, encoded by ERBB2, can be overexpressed in a variety of malignancies ▸ HER2 overexpression is defined as 3+ tumor cell staining, based on IHC. ▸ At this time, there is no recommendation regarding specific IHC antibody clone for HER2 staining in NSCLC. ▸ Scoring criteria for anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody/antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy is currently based on criteria initially applied in gastric carcinoma, which utilizes different scoring criteria than that utilized for breast carcinoma and employs different scoring criteria for small biopsy specimens versus resections. • PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) ▸ Sub-bullet 2, diamond 2 modified: Although PD-L1 expression can be elevated in patients with an oncogenic driver, targeted therapy for the-certain oncogenic drivers should take precedence over treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

Approximately 85% to 90% of cases are caused by voluntary or involuntary (second-hand) cigarette smoking. Reduction of lung cancer mortality will require effective public health policies to prevent initiation of smoking, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight of tobacco products, and other tobacco control measures. • The number of lung cancers in individuals who do not smoke is increasing worldwide. More research is necessary to identify relevant risk factors—such as environmental exposures (eg, indoor and outdoor air pollution, radon, asbestos), chronic lung diseases, and family history/ genetic predisposition—to augment lung cancer screening in the future. • Persistent smoking is associated with second primary cancers, treatment complications, drug interactions, other tobacco-related medical conditions, diminished quality of life, and reduced survival. • Reports from the Surgeon General on both active smoking and second-hand smoke show that both cause lung cancer. The evidence shows a 20% to 30% increase in the risk for lung cancer from second-hand smoke exposure associated with living with a person who smokes. Every person should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature, and mortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke, and effective legislative, executive, administrative, or other measures should be contemplated at the appropriate governmental level to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke. • Further complicating this problem, the delivery system of lung carcinogens also contains the highly addictive substance, nicotine. Reduction of lung cancer mortality will require widespread implementation of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Guidelines to identify, counsel, and treat patients with nicotine habituation. • Patients who smoke or who formerly smoked have significant risk for the development of lung cancer; chemoprevention agents are not yet established for these patients. When possible, these patients should be encouraged to enroll in chemoprevention trials. • Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT (LDCT) is recommended in select patients at high risk for lung cancer who smoke or formerly smoked (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening). • See the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation.

A biopsy adds time, costs, and procedural risk and may not be needed for treatment decisions. ‣ If a preoperative tissue diagnosis has not been obtained, then an intraoperative diagnosis (ie, wedge resection, needle biopsy) is necessary before lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy. ‣ Situations in which a preoperative biopsy may be appropriate: ◊ A non-lung cancer diagnosis that can be diagnosed by minimally invasive biopsy is at least moderately likely (eg, granulomatous nodule due to endemic fungus). ◊ Suspected stage IB or higher lung cancer in patients who may be candidates for systemic therapy prior to surgery. ◊ An intraoperative diagnosis appears difficult or very risky.1 ◊ To establish the diagnosis prior to stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).2 1 Patients require tissue confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before a lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy.

For patients undergoing EBUS/endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) staging, this most commonly should be a separate procedure to allow for pathologic evaluation. ▸ Patients having mediastinoscopy should preferably undergo invasive mediastinal staging (mediastinoscopy) as the initial step before the planned resection (during the same anesthetic procedure), rather than as a separate procedure. ▸ A separate staging procedure adds time, costs, coordination of care, inconvenience, and an additional anesthetic risk. ▸ Preoperative invasive mediastinal staging may be appropriate for a strong clinical suspicion of N2 or N3 nodal disease or when intraoperative cytology or frozen section analysis is not available. • In patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many techniques are available for tissue diagnosis. ▸ Diagnostic tools that should be routinely available include: ◊ Sputum cytology ◊ Bronchoscopy with biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) ◊ Image-guided transthoracic needle core biopsies (preferred) or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) ◊ Thoracentesis ◊ Mediastinoscopy ◊ Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open surgical biopsy ◊ Left anterior mediastinotomy/Chamberlain ▸ Diagnostic tools that provide important additional strategies for biopsy include: ◊ EBUS–guided biopsy ◊ EUS–guided biopsy ◊ Navigational bronchoscopy ◊ Robotic bronchoscopy Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Factors to be considered in choosing the optimal diagnostic step include: ♦ Anticipated diagnostic yield (sensitivity) ♦ Diagnostic accuracy including specificity and particularly the reliability of a negative diagnostic study (ie, true negative) ♦ Adequate volume of tissue specimen for diagnosis and molecular testing ♦ Invasiveness and risk of procedure ♦ Efficiency of evaluation – Access and timeliness of procedure – Concomitant staging is beneficial, because it avoids additional biopsies or procedures. It is preferable to biopsy the pathology that would confer the highest stage (ie, to biopsy a suspected metastasis or mediastinal lymph node rather than the pulmonary lesion). Therefore, FDG-PET/CT imaging is frequently best performed before a diagnostic biopsy site is chosen in cases of high clinical suspicion for aggressive, advanced-stage tumors. ♦ Technologies and expertise available ♦ Tumor viability at proposed biopsy site from FDG-PET/CT imaging Decisions about the optimal diagnostic steps for suspected stage I to III lung cancer should be made by thoracic radiologists, interventional radiologists, thoracic surgeons, and pulmonologists who devote a significant portion of their practice to thoracic oncology. Multidisciplinary evaluation should also include a pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon with expertise in advanced bronchoscopic techniques for diagnosis. The least invasive biopsy with the highest yield is preferred as the first diagnostic study. ♦ Patients with central masses and suspected endobronchial involvement should undergo bronchoscopy. ♦ Patients with pulmonary nodules may benefit from navigational bronchoscopy (including robotic), radial EBUS, or transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA). ♦ Patients with suspected nodal disease should be biopsied by EBUS, EUS, navigational bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy. – EBUS provides access to nodal stations 2R/2L, 3P, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, 11–13, and other hilar nodal stations if necessary. – An EBUS-TBNA negative for malignancy in a clinically (FDG-PET/CT and/or CT) positive mediastinum should undergo subsequent mediastinoscopy prior to surgical resection. – EUS-guided biopsy provides additional access to stations 3P, 5, 7, 8, and 9 lymph nodes if these are clinically suspicious. – TTNA and anterior mediastinotomy (ie, Chamberlain procedure) provide additional access to anterior mediastinal (stations 3a, 5, and 6) lymph nodes. If TTNA is not possible due to proximity to aorta, VATS biopsy is also an option. ♦ EUS also provides reliable access to the left adrenal gland. ♦ Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE), when available, helps to increase diagnostic and molecular yield. ♦ Patients with lung cancer with an associated pleural effusion should undergo thoracentesis and cytology. A negative pleural cytology result does not exclude pleural involvement. Thoracoscopic evaluation of the pleura should be considered before starting curative intent therapy if pleural fluid is a lymphocytic exudate with negative pleural fluid cytology. ♦ Patients suspected of having a solitary site of metastatic disease should have tissue confirmation of that site if feasible. ♦ Patients suspected of having metastatic disease should have confirmation from one of the metastatic sites if feasible. ♦ Patients who may have multiple sites of metastatic disease—based on a strong clinical suspicion—should have biopsy of the primary lung lesion or mediastinal lymph nodes if it is technically difficult or very risky to biopsy a metastatic site.

Efforts should be undertaken to minimize block reorientation and the number of IHC stains for cases that cannot be classified on histologic examination alone (see section on Immunohistochemistry). • In resection specimens, the primary purpose is a) to classify the histologic type; and b) to determine all staging parameters, as recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), including tumor size, extent of invasion, adequacy of surgical margins, and presence or absence of lymph node metastases. ▸ The number of involved lymph node stations should be documented since it has prognostic significance (AJCC 8th ed). Direct extension of the primary tumor into an adjacent lymph node is considered as nodal involvement. ▸ All lobectomy specimens should be extensively dissected to search for involved lymph nodes. ▸ In small biopsies or cytology specimens—obtained for molecular testing in the context of an established diagnosis after progression on targeted therapies—the primary purpose is a) to confirm the original pathologic type with minimal use of tissue for IHC only in suspected small cell carcinoma transformation or a different histology; and b) to preserve material for molecular analysis. ▸ Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material is suitable for most molecular analyses, except bone biopsies that were previously treated with acid decalcifying solutions. Non-acid decalcification approaches may be successful for subsequent molecular testing. While many molecular pathology laboratories currently also accept cytopathology specimens such as cell blocks, direct smears, or touch preparations, laboratories that do not currently do so are strongly encouraged to identify approaches to testing on non-FFPE cytopathology specimens. ¹ Non-small cell carcinomas (NSCC, without the L for lung) that show no clear adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma morphology or IHC markers are regarded as NSCC-NOS. In this setting, it is recommended that pathologists use the term NSCC rather than NSCLC, because the lack of pneumocyte marker expression in small biopsies or cytology leaves open the possibility of a metastatic carcinoma and the determination of a lung primary must be established clinically after excluding other primary sites.

Multiple synchronous AIS tumors can also occur. – Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA): A small (≤3 cm) solitary adenocarcinoma with a predominantly lepidic pattern and ≤5 mm invasion in greatest dimension. MIA is usually non-mucinous, but rarely may be mucinous. MIA is, by definition, solitary and discrete. – Invasive adenocarcinoma: A malignant epithelial tumor with glandular differentiation, mucin production, or pneumocyte marker expression. The tumors show an acinar, papillary, micropapillary, lepidic, or solid growth pattern, with either mucin or pneumocyte marker expression. The invasive adenocarcinoma component should be present in at least one focus measuring >5 mm in greatest dimension. – Invasive adenocarcinoma variants: invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, colloid adenocarcinoma, fetal adenocarcinoma, and enteric adenocarcinoma. – Refer to College of American Pathologists Protocols for additional information. ▸ Adenosquamous carcinoma: A carcinoma showing components of both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, with each component constituting at least 10% of the tumor. Definitive diagnosis requires a resection specimen, although it may be suggested based on findings in small biopsies, cytology, or excisional biopsies. Presence of any adenocarcinoma component in a biopsy specimen that is otherwise squamous should trigger molecular testing. ▸ Large cell carcinoma: Undifferentiated NSCC that lacks the cytologic, architectural, and histochemical features of small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnosis requires a thoroughly sampled resected tumor with IHC stains that exclude adenocarcinoma (thyroid transcription factor-1 [TTF-1], napsin A) and squamous cell (p40, p63) carcinoma. This diagnosis cannot be made on non-resection or cytology specimens. ▸ Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a general term that includes pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. For this reason, it is best to use the specific term for these entities whenever possible rather than the general term. ◊ Pleomorphic carcinoma is a poorly differentiated NSCC that contains at least 10% spindle and/or giant cells or a carcinoma consisting only of spindle and giant cells. Spindle cell carcinoma consists of an almost pure population of epithelial spindle cells, while Giant cell carcinoma consists almost entirely of tumor giant cells. ◊ Carcinosarcoma is a malignant tumor that consists of a mixture of NSCC and sarcoma-containing heterologous elements (eg, rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma). ◊ Pulmonary blastoma is a biphasic tumor that consists of fetal adenocarcinoma (typically low grade) and primitive mesenchymal stroma.

IHC用于区分原发性肺腺癌与鳞状细胞癌、大细胞癌、转移性癌和原发性胸膜间皮瘤（特别是胸膜标本）。6. 对于原发性肺腺癌，当癌的原发来源不确定时，推荐使用适当的IHC染色面板来评估肺部转移性癌。TTF-1是一种在胚胎和成熟肺及甲状腺的上皮细胞中表达的核转录蛋白，在非粘液性腺癌亚型中，大多数（70%-90%）原发性肺腺癌可见TTF-1免疫反应性。转移性腺癌到肺部通常对TTF-1呈阴性，但在转移性甲状腺恶性肿瘤中例外。Napsin A在正常II型肺泡细胞和近端及远端肾小管中表达，在超过80%的肺腺癌中表达，可作为TTF-1的有用补充。TTF-1（或替代napsin A）和p40（或替代p63）的组合面板可能有助于细化先前分类为NSCC-NOS的小活检标本的诊断。", "original_text": "National Comprehensive Cancer Network® NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGIC REVIEW Immunohistochemistry • Judicious use of IHC is strongly recommended to preserve tissue for molecular testing, most notably in small specimens. When adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinomas are poorly differentiated, the defining morphologic criteria that would allow for specific diagnosis may be inconspicuous or absent. In this case, IHC or mucin staining may be necessary to determine a specific diagnosis. • In small specimens, a limited number of immunostains with one lung adenocarcinoma marker (TTF-1, napsin A) and one squamous carcinoma marker (p40, p63) should suffice for most diagnostic problems. Virtually all tumors that lack squamous cell morphology and show co-expression of p63 and TTF-1 are preferably classified as adenocarcinoma. A simple panel of TTF-1 and p40 may be sufficient to classify most NSCC-NOS cases. • Testing for nuclear protein in testis (NUT) expression by IHC should be considered in all poorly differentiated carcinomas that lack glandular differentiation or specific etiology, particularly in patients who do not smoke or in patients presenting at a young age, for consideration of a pulmonary NUT carcinoma. • IHC should be used to differentiate primary lung adenocarcinoma from squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, metastatic carcinoma, and primary pleural mesothelioma (particularly for pleural specimens). • Primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma: ▶ In patients for whom the primary origin of the carcinoma is uncertain, an appropriate panel of IHC stains is recommended to assess for metastatic carcinoma to the lung. ▶ TTF-1 is a homeodomain-containing nuclear transcription protein of the NKX2 gene family that is expressed in epithelial cells of the embryonic and mature lung and thyroid. TTF-1 immunoreactivity is seen in primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma in the majority (70%–90%) of non-mucinous adenocarcinoma subtypes. Metastatic adenocarcinoma to the lung is nearly always negative for TTF-1 except in metastatic thyroid malignancies, in which case thyroglobulin and PAX8 are also positive. Rare cases of TTF-1 positivity in tumors of other organs (gynecologic tract, pancreatobiliary) have been noted, and may be dependent on the specific TTF-1 clone utilized, stressing the importance of correlation with clinical and radiologic features. ▶ Napsin A—an aspartic proteinase expressed in normal type II pneumocytes and in proximal and distal renal tubules—appears to be expressed in >80% of lung adenocarcinomas and may be a useful adjunct to TTF-1. ▶ The panel of TTF-1 (or alternatively napsin A) and p40 (or alternatively p63) may be useful in refining the diagnosis to either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma in small biopsy specimens previously classified as NSCC-NOS.

Other potentially useful markers that can be considered include B72.3, Ber-EP4, MOC-31, and CD15, but these generally do not have the sensitivity and specificity of the above markers. ▸ A pancytokeratin such as AE1/AE3 is also useful, as a negative result suggests the possibility of other tumors. ▸ Other markers can be helpful in the differential diagnosis between pleural mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma, and will also help determine the tumor origin. Examples include markers for lung adenocarcinoma (TTF-1 and napsin A), breast carcinoma (ERα, PR, GCDFP-15, mammaglobin, and GATA-3), renal cell carcinoma (PAX8), papillary serous carcinoma (PAX8, PAX2, and ER), adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (CDX2), and prostate cancer (NKX3.1). Additionally, p40 (or p63) is helpful for distinguishing epithelioid pleural mesotheliomas with pseudosquamous morphology from squamous cell carcinomas.

Thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of the evaluation of any patient being considered for curative local therapy. In cases where SABR is considered for patients at high risk or who are borderline operable, a multidisciplinary evaluation including a radiation oncologist is recommended. • The overall plan of treatment as well as needed imaging studies should be determined before any non-emergency treatment is initiated. • Thoracic surgeons should actively participate in multidisciplinary discussions and meetings regarding patients with lung cancer (eg, multidisciplinary clinic and/or tumor board). • Patients who actively smoke should be provided counseling and smoking cessation support (NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation). While patients who actively smoke have a mildly increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications, these should not be considered a prohibitive risk for surgery. Surgeons should not deny surgery to patients solely due to smoking status, as surgery provides the predominant therapy for patients with early-stage lung cancer.

Preoperative sampling with EBUS or mediastinoscopy should be part of N2 assessment to achieve 3 N2 nodal stations.\n• Formal ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node dissection is indicated for patients undergoing resection for N2 disease.\n• Complete resection requires free resection margins, systematic node dissection or sampling, and the highest mediastinal node negative for tumor. The resection is defined as incomplete whenever there is involvement of resection margins, unremoved positive lymph nodes, or positive pleural or pericardial effusions. A complete resection is referred to as R0, microscopically positive resection as R1, and macroscopic residual tumor as R2.\n• Patients with clinical stage IB or greater, or high-risk factors, should be referred to medical oncology for evaluation.\n• Consider referral to a radiation oncologist for N2 disease.\nThe Role of Surgery in Patients with N2 NSCLC\nThe role of surgery in patients with pathologically documented N2 disease remains controversial.6 Two randomized trials evaluated the role of surgery in this population, but neither showed an overall survival benefit with the use of surgery.7,8 However, this population is heterogeneous and the Panel believes that these trials did not sufficiently evaluate the nuances present with the heterogeneity of N2 disease and the likely oncologic benefit of surgery in specific clinical situations.\n• The presence or absence of N2 disease should be vigorously determined by both radiologic and invasive staging prior to the initiation of therapy since the presence of mediastinal nodal disease has a profound impact on prognosis and treatment decisions. (NSCL-1, NSCL-2, NSCL-3, NSCL-5, NSCL-8, NSCL-11, NSCL-13, and NSCL-14)\n• Patients with occult-positive N2 nodes discovered at the time of pulmonary resection should continue with the planned resection along with formal mediastinal lymph node dissection. If N2 disease is noted in patients undergoing VATS, the surgeon may consider stopping the procedure so that induction therapy can be administered before surgery; however, continuing the procedure is also an option.\n• The determination of the role of surgery in a patient with N2-positive lymph nodes should be made prior to the initiation of any therapy by a multidisciplinary team, including a thoracic surgeon who has a major part of their practice dedicated to thoracic oncology.9\n• The presence of N2-positive lymph nodes substantially increases the likelihood of positive N3 lymph nodes. Pathologic evaluation of the mediastinum must include evaluation of the subcarinal station and contralateral lymph nodes. EBUS ± EUS are additional techniques for minimally invasive pathologic mediastinal staging that are complementary to mediastinoscopy. Even when these modalities are employed it is important to have an adequate evaluation of the number of stations involved and biopsy and documentation of negative contralateral lymph node involvement prior to a final treatment decision.\nThe Role of Surgery in Patients with N2 NSCLC is continued on NSCL-B 4 of 6 through NSCL-B 5 of 6\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated."}

One possible strategy is to perform EBUS (± EUS) in the initial pretreatment evaluation and reserve mediastinoscopy for nodal restaging after neoadjuvant therapy.10\n• Patients with a single lymph node <3 cm can be considered for a multimodality approach that includes surgical resection.6,11,12\n• Restaging after induction therapy is difficult to interpret, but CT ± FDG-PET/CT should be performed to exclude disease progression or interval development of metastatic disease.\n• Patients with negative mediastinum after neoadjuvant therapy have a better prognosis.12,13\n• Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is used in one-third of the NCCN Member Institutions, while neoadjuvant chemotherapy is used in the other two-thirds. Overall survival appears similar provided RT is given postoperatively, if not given preoperatively.10,14 Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is associated with higher rates of pathologic complete response and negative mediastinal lymph nodes.15 However, that is achieved at the expense of higher rates of acute toxicity and increased cost.\n• When neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is used with doses lower than those used for standard definitive therapy, all efforts should be made to minimize any possible breaks in radiotherapy for surgical evaluation. Treatment breaks of >1 week are considered unacceptable.\n• When timely surgical evaluation is not available, the strategy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should not be used. Another option in individual cases, and with the agreement of the thoracic surgeon, is to complete definitive chemoradiotherapy prior to re-evaluation and consideration for surgery.16,17 If a surgeon or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of resection after definitive doses of radiation, consider obtaining an additional surgical opinion from a high-volume specialized center. These operations may also benefit from additional considerations of soft tissue flap coverage in the radiation field at the time of resection.\n• Data from a large multi-institutional trial indicate that pneumonectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has unacceptable morbidity and mortality.7 However, it is not clear if this is also true with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. Further, many groups have challenged that cooperative group finding with single-institution experiences demonstrating safety of pneumonectomy after induction therapy.18-21 In addition, there is no evidence that adding RT to induction regimens for patients with operable stage IIIA (N2) disease improves outcomes compared to induction chemotherapy.22\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated."}

General Principles • Determination of the appropriateness of RT should be made by radiation oncologists who perform lung cancer RT as a prominent part of their practice. • RT has a potential role in all stages of NSCLC, as either definitive/consolidative or palliative therapy. Radiation oncology input as part of a multidisciplinary evaluation or discussion should be provided for all patients with stage III NSCLC, with early-stage disease who are medically inoperable, who refuse surgery, or who are high-risk surgical candidates, and with stage IV disease that may benefit from local therapy. • The critical goals of modern RT are to maximize tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity. A minimum technologic standard is CT-planned 3D-conformal RT (CRT).1 • More advanced technologies are appropriate when needed to deliver curative RT safely. These technologies include (but are not limited to) 4D-CT, FDG-PET/CT and/or MRI simulation, intensity-modulated RT (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), image-guided RT (IGRT), motion management, and proton therapy (https://www.astro.org/Daily-Practice/Reimbursement/Model-Policies/Model-Policies). Nonrandomized comparisons of using advanced technologies demonstrate reduced toxicity and improved survival versus older techniques.2-4 In a prospective trial of definitive/consolidative chemotherapy/RT for patients with stage III NSCLC (RTOG 0617), IMRT was associated with a nearly 60% decrease (from 7.9% to 3.5%) in high-grade radiation pneumonitis as well as similar survival and tumor control outcomes despite a higher proportion of stage IIIB and larger treatment volumes compared to 3D-CRT;5 as such, IMRT is preferred over 3D-CRT in this setting. In retrospective studies, intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) has also been shown to reduce the toxicities as compared with 3D-based passive scattering proton therapy in stage III NSCLC.3 • Highly conformal RT, such as IMRT or proton therapy, should be used in the setting of prior RT, potentially with hyperfractionation, to reduce risk of toxicity. • Centers using advanced technologies should implement and document modality-specific quality assurance measures. The ideal is external credentialing of both treatment planning and delivery such as required for participation in RTOG clinical trials employing advanced technologies. Useful references include the ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards (https://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/ PGTS/toc.pdf). • The interaction of strong vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors with prior or subsequent dose-intensive RT (SABR or definitive dose accelerated fractionation) involving the proximal bronchial tree, hilar vessels, or esophagus can lead to serious toxicity. Careful coordination of medical and radiation oncology on the therapeutic strategy is important, including the choice and sequencing of systemic agents with strong VEGF inhibitors and the dose and fractionation of radiation, especially for patients with metastatic disease. II. Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery • Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT treatment position with appropriate immobilization devices. IV contrast with or without oral contrast is recommended for better target/organ delineation whenever possible in patients with central tumors or nodal disease. Because IV contrast can affect tissue heterogeneity correction calculations, density masking or use of a pre-contrast scan may be needed when intense enhancement is present.

Radiation Therapy Simulation, Planning, and Delivery (continued) • FDG-PET/CT significantly improves targeting accuracy, especially for patients with significant atelectasis and when IV CT contrast is contraindicated. A randomized trial of FDG-PET/CT versus CT-only RT planning demonstrated improved preemption of futile radical RT, decreased recurrences, and a trend toward improved overall survival with FDG-PET/CT RT planning. Given the potential for rapid progression of NSCLC, FDG-PET/CT should be obtained preferably within 4 weeks before treatment. It is ideal to obtain FDG-PET/CT in the treatment position. • Tumor and organ motion, especially owing to breathing, should be assessed or accounted for at simulation. Options include fluoroscopy, inhale/exhale or slow scan CT, or, ideally, 4D-CT. • Photon beam energy should be individualized based on the anatomic location of the tumors and beam paths. In general, photon energies between 4 to 10 MV are recommended for beams passing through low-density lung tissue before entering the tumor. When there is no air gap before the beam enters the tumor (such as for some large mediastinal tumors or tumors attached to the chest wall), higher energies may improve the dose distribution, especially when using a smaller number of fixed beam angles. • Tissue heterogeneity correction and accurate dose calculation algorithms are recommended that account for buildup and lateral electron scatter effects in heterogeneous density tissues. Heterogeneity correction with simple pencil beam algorithms is not recommended. • Respiratory motion should be managed when motion is excessive. This includes (but is not limited to) forced shallow breathing with abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating with the respiratory cycle, dynamic tumor tracking, active breathing control (ABC), or coaching/biofeedback techniques. If motion is minimal or the ITV is small, motion-encompassing targeting is appropriate. A useful resource for implementation of respiratory motion management is the report of AAPM Task Group 76. • IGRT—including (but not limited to) orthogonal pair planar imaging and/or volumetric imaging (such as cone-beam CT [CBCT], CT on rails, or MRI)—is recommended when using SABR, 3D-CRT/IMRT, and proton therapy with steep dose gradients around the target, when organs at risk (OARs) are in close proximity to high-dose regions, and when using complex motion management techniques. III. Target Volumes, Prescription Doses, and Normal Tissue Dose Constraints (See Tables 1–4 on NSCL-C 6 of 10 and NSCL-C 7 of 10) • ICRU Reports 62 and 83 detail the current definitions of target volumes for 3D-RT and IMRT. Gross tumor volume (GTV) comprises the known extent of disease (primary and nodal) on imaging and pathologic assessment, clinical target volume (CTV) includes regions of presumed microscopic extent or dissemination, and planning target volume (PTV) comprises the internal target volume (ITV; which includes margin for target motion) plus a setup margin for positioning and mechanical variability (https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung). • PTV margin can be decreased by immobilization, motion management, and IGRT techniques. • Consistent delineation of normal structures is critical for evaluating plans for safety. The RTOG consensus lung-contouring atlas is a useful resource (https://www.nrgoncology.org/ciro-lung). • Commonly used prescription doses and normal tissue dose constraints are summarized in Tables 1 through 4. These are based on published experience, ongoing trials, historical data, modeling, and empirical judgment. Useful references include the recent reviews of normal organ dose responses from the QUANTEC project. Because risk of normal organ toxicity increases with dose, doses to normal organs should be kept as low as reasonably achievable rather than simply meeting nominal constraints. This is generally facilitated by more advanced techniques to achieve better dose conformity. Continued Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

General Treatment Information Early-Stage NSCLC (stage I, selected node-negative stage IIA) • SABR (also known as stereotactic body RT [SBRT])19 has achieved good primary tumor control rates and overall survival, as well as higher than conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Although SABR is not proven equivalent to lobectomy, some prospective series have demonstrated similar overall and cancer-specific survival with reduced acute toxicity.20-31 • SABR is also an appropriate option for patients with high surgical risk (able to tolerate sublobar resection but not lobectomy [eg, age ≥75 years, poor lung or cardiac function]). • More modestly hypofractionated or dose-intensified conventionally fractionated highly conformal radiation (IMRT with IGRT preferred) are less preferred alternatives and may be considered if referral for SABR is not feasible.32-34 • In patients treated with surgery, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) is not recommended unless there are positive margins (see Locally Advanced NSCLC in this section for patients upstaged to N2). • Close follow-up and therapy for isolated local and/or locoregional recurrence after SABR have been shown to improve overall survival in a large retrospective study.35 SABR for Node-Negative Early-Stage NSCLC • The high-dose intensity and conformity of SABR require minimizing the PTV. • Dosing regimen ▸ For SABR, intensive regimens of biologically effective dose (BED) ≥100 Gy are associated with significantly better local control and survival than less intensive regimens.36,37 In the United States, only regimens of ≤5 fractions meet the arbitrary billing code definition of SBRT, but slightly more protracted regimens are appropriate as well.36,38 For centrally located tumors (defined variably as within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree and/or abutting mediastinal pleura) and even ultra-central tumors (defined as abutting the proximal bronchial tree or, in some definitions, other critical mediastinal structures as well), 4 to 10 fraction risk-adapted SABR regimens appear to be effective and safe,39-42 while 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions is unsafe and should be avoided.43 However, particular attention should be paid to tumors abutting the bronchial tree and esophagus to avoid severe toxicity. RTOG 0813 evaluated the toxicity of 5-fraction regimens and found no high-grade toxicities at 50 Gy in 5 fractions.44 • SABR is most commonly used for tumors up to 5 cm in size, though selected larger isolated tumors can be treated safely if normal tissue constraints are respected.44,45 • Retrospective data suggest that chemotherapy in addition to SABR provides a survival advantage for patients with large tumors (≥5 cm).46 Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for large tumors in selected patients for whom it is safe. • Prescription doses incompletely describe the actual delivered doses, which also strongly depend on how the dose is prescribed (to the isocenter vs. an isodose volume covering a proportion of the PTV), the degree of dose heterogeneity, whether tissue density heterogeneity corrections are used, and the type of dose calculation algorithm.10,47,48 All of these must be considered when interpreting or emulating regimens from prior studies.

Upfront multidisciplinary consultation is particularly important when considering surgical treatment of patients with stage III NSCLC. • In patients with clinical stage I/II upstaged surgically to N2 with completely resected disease, two randomized studies did not show an overall survival benefit of PORT, although locoregional control was significantly improved.63,64 PORT (generally following postoperative chemotherapy) may be considered for selected patients with high-risk N2 disease, such as extracapsular extension, multi-station involvement, inadequate lymph node dissection/sampling, and/or refusal or intolerance of adjuvant systemic therapy. To minimize potential lung and heart toxicities, highly conformal RT techniques such as IMRT or proton therapy are preferred.65-68 • In patients with completely resected pN1 receiving adjuvant systemic therapy, PORT is not recommended. PORT may be considered for these patients if they are unable to receive adjuvant systemic therapy.62 Conventionally Fractionated RT for Locally Advanced NSCLC • Involved field irradiation (IFI) omitting elective nodal irradiation (ENI) allows tumor dose escalation and is associated with a low risk of isolated nodal relapse, particularly in a patient staged with FDG-PET/CT.69-73 Three randomized trials found improved survival for IFI versus ENI, possibly because it enabled dose escalation.74-76 IFI is reasonable in order to optimize definitive dosing to the tumor and/or decrease normal tissue toxicity.75,76 • Dosing Regimens • The most commonly prescribed doses for definitive RT are 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Doses of at least 60 Gy should be given.77 Dose escalation is associated with better survival in non-randomized comparisons in RT alone,78 sequential chemotherapy/RT,79 or concurrent chemotherapy/RT.80 While optimal RT dose intensification remains a valid question, a high dose of 74 Gy is not currently recommended for routine use.81-86 A meta-analysis demonstrated improved survival with accelerated fractionation RT regimens,87 and RTOG 1106 found that PET-based individualized accelerated RT dose intensification potentially improved local control but not overall survival.88 Continued Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

The LungART and PORT-C trials provide useful guidelines for PORT technique.98 Highly conformal techniques to minimize lung and heart dose are preferred.\nAdvanced/Metastatic NSCLC (stage IV)\n• RT is recommended for local palliation or prevention of symptoms (such as pain, bleeding, or obstruction).\n• Definitive/consolidative local therapy to isolated or limited metastatic sites (oligometastases) (including but not limited to brain, lung, and adrenal gland) achieves prolonged survival in a small proportion of well-selected patients with good performance status (PS) who have also received radical therapy to the intrathoracic disease.99 Definitive RT to oligometastases (limited number is not universally defined but clinical trials have included 3–5 metastases), particularly SABR, is an appropriate option in such cases if it can be delivered safely to the involved sites.100,101\nIn two randomized phase II trials, significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival in one trial102,103 were found for local consolidative therapy (RT or surgery) to oligometastatic lesions versus maintenance systemic therapy or observation for patients whose disease was not progressing on systemic therapy.102-104\n• In the setting of progression at a limited number of sites on a given line of systemic therapy (oligoprogression), local ablative therapy to the oligoprogressive sites may extend the duration of benefit of the current line of systemic therapy.\n• When treating oligometastatic/oligoprogressive lesions, if SABR is not feasible, other dose-intensive accelerated/hypofractionated CRT regimens may be used.\n• See the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers regarding RT for brain metastases.\n• A pooled analysis of two randomized trials indicated that adding RT to a certain immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) significantly increased responses and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic NSCLC.105 Larger phase III randomized studies are ongoing.\nPalliative RT for Advanced/Metastatic NSCLC\n• The dose and fractionation of palliative RT should be individualized based on goals of care, symptoms, PS, and logistical considerations. Shorter courses of RT are preferred for patients with poor PS and/or shorter life expectancy because they provide similar pain relief as longer courses, although there is a higher potential need for retreatment.106-109 For palliation of thoracic symptoms, higher dose/longer-course thoracic RT (eg, ≥30 Gy in 10 fractions) is associated with modestly improved survival and symptoms, particularly in patients with good PS.110,111 When higher doses (>30 Gy) are warranted, technologies to reduce normal tissue irradiation (at least 3D-CRT and including IMRT or proton therapy as appropriate) may be used.\n• Single-fraction stereotactic RT (SRT) of 12–16 Gy produced better control of pain response and local control of non-spine bone metastases compared to standard 30 Gy in 10 fractions in a randomized phase II trial, and may be promising for patients with longer expected survival.112 SABR/SRS has been found in randomized clinical trials to produce better pain and tumor control of spine and non-spine bone metastases than conventionally fractionated palliative RT, and is appropriate especially for patients with longer expected survival.113\nNote: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated."}

Table 4. Normal Tissue Dose-Volume Constraints for Conventionally Fractionated RT with Concurrent Chemotherapy† ‡ OAR Constraints in 30–35 fractions Spinal cord Max ≤50 Gy Lung V20 ≤35%–40%; § MLD ≤20 Gy Heart V40 ≤20%; Mean ≤20 Gy Esophagus Mean ≤34 Gy; Max ≤105% of prescription dose; V60 ≤17%; contralateral sparing is desirable Brachial plexus Median dose ≤69 Gy Vxx = % of the whole OAR receiving ≥xx Gy. †These constraints represent doses that generally should not be exceeded, based on a consensus survey of NCCN Member Institutions. Because the risk of toxicity increases progressively with dose to normal tissues, a key principle of radiation treatment planning is to keep normal tissue doses “as low as reasonably achievable” while adequately covering the target. The doses to any given OAR should typically be lower than these constraints, approaching them only when there is close proximity to the target volume. ‡Speirs CK, et al.

IGTA is a form of “local therapy” or “local ablative therapy.”1 • IGTA is a lung parenchymal sparing technique with at most a temporary decrement in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which is statistically indistinguishable from baseline after recovery.2-6 Evaluation • IGTA may be considered for those patients who are deemed “high risk”—those with tumors that are for the most part surgically resectable but rendered medically inoperable due to comorbidities. In cases where IGTA is considered for patients who are high risk or borderline operable, a multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended. • IGTA has been successfully accomplished in patients considered “high risk,” objectively defined with a single major and/or two or more minor criteria. Major criteria included an FEV1 or DLCO ≤50%, and minor criteria included a less depressed FEV1 or DLCO between 51%-60%, age ≥75 years, pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%, resting or exercise PaO2 <55 mmHg, and pCO2 >45 mmHg.4 • If an interventional radiologist or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of IGTA or the use of IGTA for radiation failure, consider obtaining an additional interventional radiology opinion from a high-volume specialized center. Ablation • Each energy modality has advantages and disadvantages. Determination of energy modality to be used for ablation should take into consideration the size and location of the target tumor, risk of complication, as well as local expertise and/or operator familiarity.7 Ablation for NSCLC • IGTA is an option for the management of NSCLC lesions <3 cm. Ablation for NSCLC lesions >3 cm may be associated with higher rates of local recurrence and complications.8,9 • There is evidence on the use of IGTA for selected patients with stage IA NSCLC, those who present with multiple lung cancers, or those who present with locoregional recurrence of symptomatic local thoracic disease. • Like surgery, pneumothorax may occur after IGTA, particularly if multiple lesions are treated in a single session. Pneumothorax has been reported in 18.7%-45.7% of IGTA cases. Self-limited pneumothorax, not requiring chest tube placement, is an expected event and not considered a complication unless escalation of care is required. In 20.7% of IGTA cases, chest tube insertion may be necessary.10 1 Lam A, Yoshida EJ, Bui K, et al.

Testing of lung cancer specimens for these alterations is important for identification of potentially efficacious targeted therapies, as well as avoidance of therapies unlikely to provide clinical benefit. • Some selection approaches for targeted therapy include predictive IHC analyses, which are distinct from IHC studies utilized to identify tumor type and lineage. • Clinicopathologic features should not be used to select patients for testing. • Major elements of molecular testing that are critical for utilization and interpretation of molecular results include: ▸ Use of a laboratory that is properly accredited, with a minimum of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) accreditation ▸ Understanding the methodologies that are utilized and the major limitations of those methodologies ▸ Understanding the spectrum of alterations tested (and those not tested) by a specific assay ▸ Knowledge of whether a tumor sample is subjected to pathologic review and tumor enrichment (ie, microdissection, macrodissection) prior to testing ▸ The types of samples accepted by the testing laboratory ▸ Understanding what constitutes an informative versus a null result. A positive finding for a known oncogenic driver is considered an informative result. Absence of a known oncogenic driver, including results that show only \"passenger\" alterations, might be considered null depending on the context of the specimen limitations and clinical situation. Specifically, technical issues related to tumor cellularity in tissue testing or burden of disease in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing are considerations in interpretation of findings. Additional considerations are elaborated in sections below. • Tissue Specimen Acquisition and Management: ▸ Although tumor testing has been primarily focused on use of FFPE tissues, increasingly, laboratories accept other specimen types, notably cytopathology preparations not processed by FFPE methods. Although testing on cell blocks is not included in the FDA approval for multiple companion diagnostic assays, testing on these specimen types is highly recommended when it is the only or best material. ▸ A major limitation in obtaining tissue molecular testing results for NSCLC occurs when minimally invasive techniques are used to obtain samples; the yield may be insufficient for molecular, biomarker, and histologic testing. Therefore, bronchoscopists and interventional radiologists should procure sufficient tissue to enable all appropriate testing. ▸ When tissue is minimal, laboratories should deploy techniques to maximize tissue for molecular and ancillary testing, including dedicated histology protocols for small biopsies, including \"up-front\" slide sectioning for diagnostic and predictive testing. Peripheral blood (plasma ctDNA) can be a surrogate sample (NSCL-H 8 of 8). • Testing Methodologies ▸ Appropriate possible testing methodologies are indicated below for each analyte separately; however, several methodologies are generally considerations for use: ◊ Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is used in clinical laboratories. Not all types of alterations are detected by individual NGS assays and it is important to be familiar with the types of alterations identifiable in individual assays or combination(s) of assays. – Broad-based genomic testing approaches that efficiently utilize limited biopsy tissue while maximizing diagnostic genomic information are most commonly NGS-based. NCCN acknowledges that many currently available NGS-based assays used to fully genotype NSCLC are larger than the 50-gene limit threshold utilized by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding convention; as a result, utilization of panels >50 genes may be practical to follow these recommendations. Either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays may be appropriate. – Although broad-based genomic testing approaches are preferred, in some clinical situations rapid testing may be warranted and should be followed up with broad-based genomic testing.

For patients who, in broad panel testing don’t have identifiable driver oncogenes, consider RNA-based NGS if not already performed, to maximize detection of fusion events. – Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all biomarkers identified in NSCL-20 in either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers (NSCL-I). Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. ♦ Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used in a highly targeted fashion (specific mutations targeted). When this technology is deployed, only those specific alterations that are targeted by the assay are assessed and the potential for mutations outside of the testing scope of the specific assay must be considered. ♦ Any method that interrogates sequences other than a subset of highly specific alterations (eg, NGS) has the potential to identify variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Any variant classified as a VUS, even if in a gene in which other variants are clinically actionable, should not be considered as a basis for targeted therapy selection. ♦ Other methodologies may be utilized, including multiplex approaches not listed above. ♦ Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is utilized for many assays examining copy number, amplification, and structural alterations such as gene rearrangements. FISH may have better sensitivity for gene amplification events in some circumstances. • Specimen Selection ♦ Testing platforms using tissue and peripheral blood are available. ♦ Testing using tissue sample requires acquisition of a suitable sample. ♦ Alterations detected using NSCLC tumor tissue can be most directly attributed to the tumor. ♦ If an assay has a technical failure related to an insufficient quantity, consideration of an alternate testing modality or procurement of additional tissue is recommended to achieve broad molecular profiling. ♦ Testing using peripheral blood (most commonly plasma-based testing of ctDNA) can be utilized in conjunction with tissue-based testing to achieve genotyping for recommended biomarkers. ♦ Many, but not all, ctDNA tests use NGS-based technology.

EGFR 20号外显子（EGFRex20）突变（除p.T790M外）是一组异质性突变，部分对靶向治疗有反应，具体取决于突变类型。大多数EGFRex20突变为框内重复或插入突变，通常对第一、二、三代EGFR TKI治疗无效，但特定突变（如p.A763_Y764insFQEA）可能对TKI治疗敏感。EGFRex20插入/重复突变对特定靶向后续治疗药物有反应，最常见的是insASV、insSVD和insPH。6. 检测方法方面，实时PCR和NGS是常用的EGFR突变状态检测方法，但针对EGFRex20插入事件，NGS策略更为优选。", "original_text": "National Comprehensive Cancer Network® NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer NCCN Guidelines Index Table of Contents Discussion PRINCIPLES OF MOLECULAR AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS • Molecular Targets for Analysis ▸ In general, the mutations/alterations described below are seen in a non-overlapping fashion, although between 1%-3% of NSCLC may harbor concurrent alterations. ▸ EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Gene Mutations: EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase normally found on the surface of epithelial cells and is often overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies. ◊ The most commonly described mutations in EGFR (exon 19 deletions, p.L858R point mutation in exon 21) are associated with responsiveness to oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; tumors that do not harbor a sensitizing EGFR mutation should not be treated with EGFR TKI in any line of therapy. ◊ Molecular testing for EGFR mutations should be performed when TKI therapy is a consideration for NSCLC stage IB-IIIC. While the testing process may be technically easier on a resection specimen, initial diagnostic biopsy specimens are also acceptable for testing for this indication. ◊ Many of the less commonly observed alterations in EGFR, which cumulatively account for ~10% of EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC (ie, exon 21 p.L861Q, exon 18 p.G719X, and exon 20 p.S768I mutations), are also associated with responsiveness to certain EGFR TKIs, such as osimertinib and afatinib, and should be considered on a mutation-specific basis, when possible. ◊ EGFR p.T790M is most commonly observed as a mutation that arises in response to and as a mechanism of resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR TKI. In patients with progression on first- or second-generation TKI with p.T790M as the primary mechanism of resistance, third-generation TKIs are typically efficacious. – If EGFR p.T790M is identified in the absence of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and possible germline genetic testing are warranted. Identification of germline EGFR p.T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless of smoking status. ◊ EGFR exon 20 (EGFRex20) mutations (other than EGFR p.T790M) are a heterogeneous group, some of which are responsive to targeted therapy and that require detailed knowledge of the specific alteration. – Most EGFRex20 alterations are a diverse group of in-frame duplication or insertion mutations. • These are generally associated with lack of response to first-, second-, and third-generation EGFR TKI therapy, with select exceptions: p.A763_Y764insFQEA is associated with sensitivity to TKI therapy and p.A763_Y764insLQEA may be associated with sensitivity to first- and third-generation TKI therapy. • EGFRex20 insertions/duplications are associated with responsiveness to specific targeted subsequent therapy agents designed for EGFRex20 events. The most commonly represented EGFRex20 insertions/duplications in the clinical studies have been insASV, insSVD, and insPH, although a wide spectrum of other alterations were included. There is currently no evidence that the specific alteration type impacts the probability of responsiveness to this class of targeted therapy. • Because some EGFRex20 mutations are or may be sensitive to first- and third-generation inhibitors, the specific sequence of EGFRex20 insertion mutations remains important. Some assays will identify the presence of an EGFRex20 insertion without specifying the sequence, and additional testing to further clarify the EGFRex20 insertion may be indicated for therapy selection. • Targeted PCR-based approaches for detection of EGFR variants under-detect EGFRex20 insertion events; therefore, NGS-based strategies are preferred. ◊ Testing Methodologies: Real-time PCR and NGS are the most commonly deployed methodologies for examining EGFR mutation status.

In the presence of PD-L1, T-cell activity is suppressed. ‣ Checkpoint inhibitor antibodies block the PD-1 and PD-L1 interaction, thereby improving the antitumor effects of endogenous T cells. ‣ IHC for PD-L1 can be utilized to identify disease most likely to respond to first-line anti–PD-1/PD-L1. ♦ Various antibody clones have been developed for IHC analysis of PD-L1 expression, and while several are comparable regarding intensity and proportion of cells stained, some are not. – The definition of positive and negative testing is dependent on the individual antibody, clone, and platform deployed, which may be unique to each checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The approval of multiple different assays for PD-L1 has raised concern among both pathologists and oncologists. – While some clones for PD-L1 IHC are FDA-approved for specific indications, use of multiple IHC tests is not routinely recommended, provided any individual IHC test has been internally validated for comparability for categorical results against the FDA-approved clone. – Interpretation of PD-L1 IHC in NSCLC is typically focused on the proportion of tumor cells expressing membranous staining at any level and therefore is a linear variable; scoring systems may be different in other tumor types. ♦ Although PD-L1 expression can be elevated in patients with an oncogenic driver, targeted therapy for certain oncogenic drivers should take precedence over treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

Tumors that share multiple (≥2) mutations are more likely to be clonally related; however, this may depend on the extent to which any individual mutation is extremely common in NSCLC and whether identified alterations are driver or passenger alterations. Results in which no mutations or only one mutation are identified are not informative for this evaluation. • Testing in the Setting of Progression on Targeted Therapy: ▶ For any patient with progression on targeted therapy, histologic transformation (such as small cell) is a possible mechanism of resistance. Tissue biopsy of a progressing lesion should be considered to evaluate morphology and biomarker analysis. ▶ For many of the above listed analytes, there is growing recognition of the molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy. Re-testing of a sample from a tumor that is actively progressing while exposed to targeted therapy can shed light on appropriate next therapeutic steps: ♦ For patients with an underlying EGFR sensitizing mutation who have been treated with EGFR TKI, minimum appropriate testing includes high-sensitivity evaluation for p.T790M; testing for alternate mechanisms of resistance (MET amplification, ERBB2 amplification) may be used to direct patients for additional therapies. The presence of p.T790M can direct patients to third-generation EGFR TKI therapy. – Assays for the detection of EGFR p.T790M should be designed to have an analytic sensitivity of a minimum of 5% allelic fraction. The original sensitizing mutation can be utilized as an internal control in many assays to determine whether a p.T790M is within the range of detection if present as a subclonal event. ♦ For patients with underlying ALK rearrangement who have been treated with ALK TKI, it is unclear whether identification of specific tyrosine kinase domain mutation can identify appropriate next steps in therapy, although some preliminary data suggest that specific kinase domain mutations may impact the next line of therapy. ♦ Broad genomic profiling may be the most informative approach to examining potential mechanisms of resistance, which may require more than one instance of such profiling over the course of an individual patient’s therapy. Assay methodology selection can impact the ability to identify subclonal events in this setting. Continued Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

From 2015 to 2016, 2-year relative survival for NSCLC was 42% compared with 34% from 2009 to 2010.10 Patients with NSCLC who are eligible for targeted therapies or immunotherapies are now surviving longer; 5-year survival rates range from 15% to 62.5%, depending on the biomarker.9,11-27 Therefore, biomarker testing is critical to guide treatment selection and ensure optimal outcomes in patients with NSCLC, particularly for those with advanced or metastatic disease.

Literature Search Criteria Prior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in NSCLC published since the previous Guidelines update, using the search term: non-small cell lung cancer. The PubMed database was chosen because it is the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature. The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase 2; Clinical Trial, Phase 3; Clinical Trial, Phase 4; Guideline; Meta-Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trial; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies. Data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion. Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of equity, inclusion, and representation. NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-fat-biased; and inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing on organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate language in their future analyses. Risk Factors The primary risk factor for lung cancer is smoking tobacco, which accounts for most lung cancer-related deaths. Approximately 350 people die every day from lung cancer in the United States; most of these deaths (81%) are caused by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoke contains many carcinogenic chemicals (eg, nitrosamines, benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide). The risk for lung cancer increases with the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day and with the number of years spent smoking (ie, pack-years of smoking history). Individuals who do not smoke also have an increased relative risk (RR = 1.24) of developing lung cancer if they are exposed to tobacco smoke from those who smoke, termed second-hand smoke; other studies have reported a modest risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05). Other possible risk factors for lung cancer include disease history (eg, COPD), cancer history, family history of lung cancer, and exposure to other carcinogens (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org). The International Agency for Research on Cancer lists several agents known to cause lung cancer, including arsenic, asbestos, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, coal smoke, diesel fumes, nickel, silica, soot, and uranium.

It is estimated that about 3% to 4% of lung cancers are caused by asbestos exposure.43 Asbestos also causes pleural mesothelioma (see the NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Pleural, available at www.NCCN.org). Radon gas, a radioactive gas that is produced by the decay of radium 226, also seems to cause lung cancer.\n\nIt is not clear whether hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects the risk for lung cancer in women. More than 20 studies have been published, but the results have been inconsistent. In a large randomized controlled study, no increase in the incidence of lung cancer was found among postmenopausal women treated with estrogen plus progestin HRT; however, the risk of death increased in those with NSCLC.44 In women who received estrogen alone, the incidence or risk of death from lung cancer did not increase.45\n\nSmoking Cessation\nApproximately 85% to 90% of cases of lung cancer are caused by cigarette smoking.30 Of patients aged 20 to 49 years who were recently diagnosed with lung cancer, 81% of men and 72% of the women had smoked.46 Active smoking causes lung cancer; individuals who formerly smoked are at increased risk for lung cancer compared with those who have never smoked. There is a causal relationship between active smoking and lung cancer and also between other cancers (eg, bladder, cervical, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, kidney, laryngeal, oral cavity, ovarian cancer, pancreatic, pharyngeal) and other diseases and conditions.30 Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body; individuals who smoke have increased mortality compared with those who do not smoke.47 Those who do not smoke, but live with someone who smokes, have an increased risk for lung cancer due to secondhand smoke.35\n\nFurther complicating this problem, cigarettes also contain nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance.\n\nOncologists should encourage smoking cessation, especially in patients with cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at www.NCCN.org).48-51 The 5 A’s framework is a useful tool (that is, Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange).52 It is in the best interest of patients to quit smoking tobacco. Persistent smoking is associated with second primary cancers, treatment complications, and decreased survival.53 Some surgeons will not operate on individuals who currently smoke, because active smoking may increase postoperative pulmonary complications.54 However, active smoking should not be used to exclude patients with early-stage lung cancer from surgical treatment that will prolong survival. Programs using behavioral counseling combined with medications that promote smoking cessation (approved by the FDA) can be very useful.55 The American Cancer Society (ACS) has resources on How to Quit Using Tobacco.\n\nAgents that can be used to promote smoking cessation include nicotine replacement (eg, gum, inhaler, lozenge, nasal spray, patch), bupropion sustained release, and varenicline.56,57 A study suggests that cytisine is more efficacious than nicotine replacement therapy, although more side effects were reported with cytisine such as nausea, vomiting, and sleep disorders.58 Studies have shown that varenicline is better than bupropion or nicotine patch for smoking cessation.59-61 The effectiveness of varenicline for preventing relapse has not been clearly established.62 The FDA has issued an alert for varenicline regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms. Varenicline has also been associated with visual disturbances, movement disorders, unconsciousness, and cardiovascular disorders; therefore, it is banned in truck and bus drivers, pilots, and air traffic controllers.63-66 Other side effects of varenicline include nausea, abnormal dreams, insomnia, and headache.61,67,68 Bupropion may also be"}

At 10 years of follow-up, NELSON demonstrated a reduction in lung cancer mortality in men of 24% (cumulative rate ratio for death from lung cancer: 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.94; P = .01).\nThe NCCN, ACS, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), American College of Chest Physicians, European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and other organizations recommend lung cancer screening using low-dose CT for select high-risk individuals who either currently or previously smoked cigarettes based on clinical trial data (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org).75-80 Low-dose CT screening and follow-up are not a substitute for smoking cessation counseling; patients should be offered smoking cessation counseling (see NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation, available at www.NCCN.org).\nClassification and Prognostic Factors\nWHO divides lung cancer into two major classes based on its biology, therapy, and prognosis: NSCLC (discussed in these guidelines) and SCLC (see the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at www.NCCN.org).81-84 NSCLC accounts for more than 80% of all lung cancer cases, and it includes two major types: 1) nonsquamous, including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other subtypes; and 2) squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma.85 Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype of lung cancer seen in the United States and is also the most frequently occurring histology in individuals who have never smoked cigarettes. The lung adenocarcinoma classification was developed by an international panel and adopted by WHO (see the Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer in this Discussion).81-84,86 All NSCLC should be classified according to subtype using the WHO Guidelines.81-82,84 The guidelines contain an extensive pathology section (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC and Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer in this Discussion).

The diagnostic algorithms for incidental solid and subsolid lung nodules, which are detected on chest CT, use cutoff thresholds of 6 mm for a positive scan result based on the Fleischner criteria (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).91-95 Note that the Fleischner Society Guidelines do not specify whether a CT with contrast is necessary for follow-up or whether a low-dose CT is sufficient. Low-dose CT is a preferred recommendation in the NCCN Guidelines unless contrast enhancement is needed for better diagnostic resolution. Solid and subsolid nodules are the two main types of pulmonary nodules that may be seen on chest CT scans. The Fleischner Society has recommendations for patients with solid and subsolid nodules.92,93 Subsolid nodules include: 1) nonsolid nodules also known as ground-glass opacities (GGOs) or ground-glass nodules (GGNs); and 2) part-solid nodules, which contain both ground-glass and solid components.93,96-98 Nonsolid nodules are mainly adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), formerly known as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) (see Adenocarcinoma in this Discussion); patients have 5-year disease-free survival of 100% if these nonsolid nodules are completely resected.86,93,96,97,99-101 Data suggest that many nonsolid nodules discovered incidentally on CT imaging will resolve and many of those that persist may not progress to clinically significant cancer.99,102,103 Solid and part-solid nodules are more likely to be invasive, faster-growing cancers, factors that are reflected in the increased suspicion and follow-up of these nodules (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org).89,92,93 All findings and factors for a patient need to be carefully evaluated in a multidisciplinary diagnostic team before establishing a diagnosis of lung cancer and before starting treatment. The NCCN Guidelines recommend biopsy or surgical excision for highly suspicious nodules seen on low-dose CT scans or further surveillance for nodules with a low suspicion of cancer, depending on the type of nodule and a multidisciplinary evaluation of other patient factors (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org). For patients having repeat scans, the most important radiologic factor is change or stability of a nodule when compared with a previous imaging study. False-positive results (eg, benign intrapulmonary lymph nodes, noncalcified granulomas) frequently occurred with low-dose CT when using the original cutoffs for nodule size deemed suspicious for malignancy from the NLST.73 The revised cutoff values for suspicious nodules recommended by the American College of Radiology and incorporated into the LungRADS system have been reported to decrease the false-positive rate from low-dose CT.104-106 Larger Tumors The NCCN Guidelines recommend that the diagnostic strategy should be individualized for each patient depending on the size and location of the"}

The diagnostic strategy needs to be decided in a multidisciplinary setting. Decisions about whether a biopsy (including what type of biopsy) or surgical excision is appropriate depend on several factors as outlined in the NSCLC algorithm, which were revised by the NCCN Panel for the 2023 update (Version 1) (see Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For example, the NCCN Panel clarified that a preoperative biopsy may be useful for patients with early-stage NSCLC (ie, clinical stage IB or more) who may be candidates for systemic therapy before surgery (also known as neoadjuvant, induction, or preoperative therapy).107 A preoperative biopsy may be appropriate if an intraoperative diagnosis seems to be difficult or very risky (such as a small and central lesion, where it is difficult to do a wedge or intraoperative core needle biopsy). The preferred biopsy technique depends on the disease site and is described in the NSCLC algorithm. For example, radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS; also known as endosonography), navigational bronchoscopy, or transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) are recommended for patients with suspected peripheral nodules.108 PET/CT imaging is useful before selecting a biopsy site, because it is better to biopsy the site that will confer the highest stage. For patients with suspected nodal disease, pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation is recommended with either noninvasive or invasive staging methods, including endoscopic ultrasound–guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), EBUS–guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), navigational bronchoscopy, robotic bronchoscopy, or mediastinoscopy (see Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Clinicians use both noninvasive and invasive methods when staging patients.109 The panel decided that a preoperative bronchoscopy may also be preferred for tissue diagnosis and/or mediastinal staging (EBUS). EBUS provides access to nodal stations 2R/2L, 3P, 4R/4L, 7, 10R/10L, 11 to 13, and other hilar nodal stations. EUS provides access to nodal stations 5, 7, 8, and 9. If pathology results from biopsy or surgical excision indicate a diagnosis of NSCLC, then further evaluation and staging need to be done so that the patient’s health care team can determine the most appropriate and effective treatment plan (see Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer, Staging, and Clinical Evaluation in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Diagnosis, staging, and planned resection (eg, lobectomy) are ideally one operative procedure for patients with early-stage disease (see the Principles of Diagnostic Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A preoperative or intraoperative tissue diagnosis of lung cancer should be established before doing a lobectomy, bi-lobectomy, or pneumonectomy. If a preoperative or intraoperative tissue diagnosis appears risky or unreliable, multidisciplinary evaluation—that includes interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, and interventional pulmonology—is recommended to determine the safest and most efficient approach, or to provide consensus that a biopsy is too risky or difficult and that anatomic resection can occur without tissue confirmation of lung cancer. Pathologic Evaluation of Lung Cancer Pathologic evaluation is done to determine whether patients have primary lung cancer or metastatic cancer, classify the histologic subtype of the lung cancer, determine the extent of invasion, establish whether the surgical margins contain cancer (ie, positive or negative margins), and conduct biomarker diagnostic studies to assess for certain somatic, disease-associated variants/mutations (eg, EGFR mutations) or immune biomarkers (eg, PD-L1) (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).110 Targeted therapy is potentially very effective in patients with NSCLC and specific driver mutations, such as EGFR mutations; therefore, tissue needs to be conserved for molecular testing Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®).

Cytology may be sufficient to distinguish adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas.121 Ideally, a diagnosis of NSCLC can be done using H&E findings, clinical findings, imaging studies, and the patient’s history, which will conserve tissue for molecular analyses. If necessary, immunohistochemistry (IHC) should be used to distinguish adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, metastatic malignancy, and primary pleural mesothelioma (particularly for pleural samplings) (see Immunohistochemistry for Diagnosis of NSCLC in this Discussion).122 Typically, treatment is not recommended until the patient has been diagnosed with NSCLC. Preoperative evaluations include examination of the following: bronchial brushings, bronchial washings, sputum, FNA biopsy, core needle biopsy, endobronchial biopsy, and transbronchial biopsy.108,123 Minimally invasive techniques can be used to obtain specimens in patients with advanced unresectable NSCLC;124,125 however, diagnosis may be more difficult when using small biopsies and cytology.106 When available, rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) may be used to ensure that transbronchial needle aspirates or EBUS specimens are adequate for diagnosis and biomarker testing.126-130 The mediastinal lymph nodes are systematically sampled to determine the staging and therapeutic options. Other lung diseases also need to be ruled out, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and coccidioidomycosis.131-133 Lobectomy or pneumonectomy specimens are evaluated intraoperatively to determine the surgical resection margin status, diagnose incidental nodules discovered at the time of surgery, or evaluate the regional lymph nodes. Postoperative evaluation provides the pathology characteristics necessary for the classification of tumor type, staging, and prognostic factors. The surgical pathology report should include the WHO histologic classification for carcinomas of the lung.82-84,134 The classification for lung adenocarcinoma was determined by an international panel and adopted by the WHO (see Adenocarcinoma in this Discussion).82-84,86 The classification recommends IHC and molecular studies (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).82,135 The use of general categories—such as non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC) or NSCC not otherwise specified (NOS)—should be minimized, because more effective treatment can be selected when the histology is known. Major subtypes of NSCLC include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, and less common subtypes that are not discussed here (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). All NSCLC should be classified according to subtype using the WHO Guidelines.82,84 Ideally, the subtype should be specified.

Adenosquamous carcinomas are tumors with mixed adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components; each component comprises at least 10% of the tumor. Molecular testing is recommended if any adenocarcinoma component is present in a biopsy specimen that is otherwise squamous. Large cell carcinomas are tumors lacking morphologic or IHC evidence of clear lineage, with negative or uninformative stains for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of large cell carcinoma requires a thoroughly sampled resected tumor and cannot be made on non-resected or cytology specimens. Large cell carcinoma cannot be accurately identified using small samples because of challenges with complete assessment of the lesion.86 Immunohistochemical stains that exclude adenocarcinoma (TTF1, Napsin A) and squamous cell carcinoma (p40, p63) need to be used before making a diagnosis of large cell carcinoma; mucin stain is also recommended to assess for occult glandular differentiation. Carcinoid tumors are treated using the neuroendocrine guidelines and not the NSCLC guidelines; however, they are part of the differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions (see the NCCN Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, available at www.NCCN.org).

Molecular testing is recommended for patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and NSCLC NOS. Testing may be considered for patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.136,137 The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends PD-L1 IHC testing (category 1) in all patients with metastatic NSCLC because FDA-approved immunotherapy agents are available for this immune biomarker (see Testing for Immune Biomarkers in this Discussion).138 Adenocarcinoma Most lung carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. The categories for adenocarcinoma include: 1) AIS, which is a preinvasive, typically solitary lesion that is usually non-mucinous; 2) MIA, which is a solitary and discrete non-mucinous lesion with a maximum area of invasion no greater than 0.5 cm; and 3) invasive adenocarcinoma variants (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Both AIS and MIA are associated with excellent survival if they are resected. The terms AIS and MIA should not be used for small samples because of challenges with complete assessment of the lesion.86 The categories of BAC or mixed subtype adenocarcinoma are no longer used to classify adenocarcinoma.86 The classification for lung adenocarcinoma was developed by an international panel and adopted by WHO.82-84,86 The lung classification recommends that use of general categories—NSCC and NSCC NOS—should be minimized, because more effective treatment can be selected when the specific subtype is known (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).139 Immunohistochemistry for Diagnosis of NSCLC To diagnose NSCLC in small tissue samples, judicious use of IHC is strongly recommended to conserve tumor tissue for molecular studies, especially in patients with advanced disease (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).122,125,139 Note that the specific IHC analyses used to identify tumor type and lineage (eg, adenocarcinoma vs. squamous cell carcinoma) are distinct from the IHC analyses used to determine whether patients are candidates for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor therapy or PD-L1 inhibitor therapy.

In small biopsy specimens previously classified as NSCC NOS, a panel of TTF-1 (or alternatively Napsin A) and p40 (or alternatively p63) may be sufficient to refine the diagnosis to either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Thus, two markers may be sufficient to distinguish adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas.86,140 An appropriate panel of IHC stains should include those relevant for evaluation of metastatic carcinomas to the lung if the primary origin of the carcinoma is uncertain. It is appropriate to first perform a limited panel of IHC to evaluate for NSCLC and, if negative, then proceed to additional IHC for evaluation of possible metastasis from a distant site. TTF-1 is very useful for distinguishing primary lung adenocarcinoma from metastatic adenocarcinoma, because most (70%-90%) non-mucinous primary adenocarcinomas are TTF-1 positive. TTF-1 is typically negative in squamous cell carcinoma.140 However, TTF-1 is also positive in tumors such as thyroid cancer and rarely in a few other organ systems.143 In addition, thyroglobulin and PAX8 are positive in tumors from patients with thyroid cancer, while they are negative in lung cancer. Immunomarkers that may be useful to assess for metastatic carcinoma to the lung include those for breast carcinoma (ERα, PR, GCDFP-15, mammaglobin, GATA-3), renal cell carcinoma (PAX8), papillary serous carcinoma (PAX8, PAX2, ER), and adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (CDX2) or prostate gland (NKX3.1). All typical and atypical carcinoid tumors are positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin. Although the cytologic diagnosis of NSCLC is generally reliable, it is more difficult to diagnose SCLC (see the NCCN Guidelines for Small Cell Lung Cancer, available at www.NCCN.org).108,140,144 Many patients with SCLC have characteristic CT and clinical findings (eg, massive lymphadenopathy, mediastinal invasion). Most SCLCs are immunoreactive for TTF-1; they are typically negative for CK34βE12 and p63.145,146 Many SCLCs also stain positively for markers of neuroendocrine differentiation, including insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1), CD56/NCAM, chromogranin, and synaptophysin. IHC should be used to confirm neuroendocrine differentiation only when appropriate morphologic features—speckled chromatin pattern, nuclear molding, and peripheral palisading—are present. CD56/NCAM, INSM1, chromogranin, and synaptophysin are used to identify neuroendocrine tumors if morphologic suspicion of neuroendocrine differentiation exists.147 One positive marker is sufficient if the staining is not ambiguous in more than 10% of the tumor cells (TCs). Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare disease (see the NCCN Guidelines for Mesothelioma: Pleural, available at www.NCCN.org).148-150 The NCCN NSCLC Panel feels that malignant mesothelioma and lung adenocarcinoma can be distinguished using clinical impression, imaging, and a limited panel of immunomarkers (if needed) to preserve tissue for molecular testing. Commonly used immunostains sensitive and specific for adenocarcinoma include pCEA, Claudin-4, TTF-1, and Napsin A (negative in mesothelioma). Other potentially useful markers include B72.3, Ber-EP4, MOC31, and CD15; however, these markers generally do not have the sensitivity and specificity of the commonly used markers. Immunostains sensitive and specific for pleural mesothelioma include WT-1, calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, and D2-40 (podoplanin antibody)"}

Other markers can be useful in the differential diagnosis between mesothelioma and metastatic carcinoma to the lung (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Staging The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (8th edition) is effective for all cancer cases recorded on or after January 1, 2018.152,153 The lung cancer staging system was revised by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)154-156 and was adopted by the AJCC.152,153,157,158 The definitions for TNM and the stage grouping for the eighth edition are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 of the staging tables (see Staging in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The descriptors of the TNM classification scheme are summarized in Table 3 of the staging tables.159 Early-stage disease is stages I and II with negative nodes (N0), whereas locally advanced disease is stages II and III with positive nodes (N+);160 advanced or metastatic disease is stage IV. Pathologic staging uses both clinical staging information (which is noninvasive and includes medical history and physical [H&P] examination, and imaging) and other invasive staging procedures (eg, thoracotomy, examination of lymph nodes using mediastinoscopy).161 From 2012 to 2018, the overall 5-year relative survival rate for adenocarcinoma was 29.6% in the United States; the 5-year survival rate for squamous cell carcinoma was 23%.162 The corresponding 5-year relative survival rates for adenocarcinoma were 70.1% for localized, 44.7% for regional, 9.6% for distant, and 20% for unstaged.162 Five-year survival after lobectomy for pathologic stage I NSCLC ranges from 45% to 65%, depending on whether the patient has stage 1A or 1B disease and on the location of the tumor.163 Another study in patients with stage I disease (n = 19,702) found that 82% had surgical resection and their 5-year overall survival was 54%; for untreated stage I NSCLC, 5-year overall survival was only 6%.164 Of patients with stage I disease who refused surgery (although it was recommended), 78% died of lung cancer within 5 years. Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers Several biomarkers have emerged as predictive and prognostic markers for NSCLC. A predictive biomarker is indicative of therapeutic efficacy, because there is an interaction between the biomarker and therapy on patient outcome. A prognostic biomarker is indicative of patient survival independent of the treatment received, because the biomarker is an indicator of the innate tumor behavior (see KRAS Mutations in this Discussion). The NSCLC Panel recommends testing for certain molecular and immune biomarkers in all appropriate patients with NSCLC to assess whether patients are eligible for targeted therapies or immunotherapies based on data showing improvement in overall survival for patients receiving targeted therapies or immunotherapies compared with traditional chemotherapy regimens.18-25 Biomarker testing is recommended in eligible patients with stage IV disease, including M1a, M1b, and M1c. Testing for certain biomarkers is now also recommended in eligible patients with resectable early-stage NSCLC (see Combined Modality Therapy in this Discussion). Predictive molecular biomarkers include ALK rearrangements, BRAF p.V600E point mutations, EGFR mutations, v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2) (also known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) mutations, Kirsten RAt Sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutations, mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor exon 14 (METex14) skipping mutations, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 1/2/3 (NTRK1/2/3) gene fusions, rearranged during transfection (RET) rearrangements, and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel added testing recommendations for ERBB2 (HER2) mutations. Emerging predictive molecular biomarkers include high-level MET amplifications (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Targeted agents are available for patients with NSCLC who have high-level MET amplifications. However, there are less data to support using these agents and they may not be FDA approved for NSCLC; therefore, they are referred to as emerging biomarkers. In 2020, the NCCN Panel deleted tumor mutational burden (TMB) as an emerging immune biomarker based on clinical trial data and other issues (see TMB in this Discussion). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends molecular testing based on clinical trial data, but strongly advises broader molecular profiling, to identify these and other rare driver mutations for which targeted therapies may be available to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment; patients may be eligible for clinical trials for some of these targeted agents. Several online resources are available that describe NSCLC driver events, such as My Cancer Genome. Resources are available to assess whether the HER2 mutations are oncogenic or likely to be oncogenic (see oncoKB.org). The presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations is predictive of treatment benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) therapy, such as osimertinib (see EGFR Mutations in this Discussion). Previously, these mutations were referred to as sensitizing EGFR mutations; however, the specific mutations are now described. The presence of EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations does not appear to be prognostic of survival for patients with NSCLC, independent of therapy. Molecular testing is also recommended in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC for less common EGFR mutations—such as EGFR S768I, L861Q, and G719X alterations—based on data showing the efficacy of certain EGFR TKIs (see NSCLC with EGFR Alterations in this Discussion). The panel also recommends testing for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of novel agents as subsequent therapy options (see NSCLC with EGFR Alterations in this Discussion). All of these EGFR mutations can be assessed in the same assay, if the assay has been appropriately validated (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Because targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for detecting EGFR mutations may under-detect EGFR exon 20 insertions, NGS-based strategies are preferred. The phrase subsequent therapy is used in these NCCN Guidelines instead of second-line or beyond therapy, because the line of therapy may vary depending on previous treatment with targeted agents. ALK rearrangements predict for benefit from targeted therapy such as alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib (see ALK Gene Rearrangements in this Discussion). Testing for ALK rearrangements and EGFR mutations is recommended (category 1 for both) for patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS so that patients with these driver mutations can receive effective treatment with targeted agents (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Testing for the other actionable mutations—including BRAF p.V600E, ERBB2 (HER2) mutations, KRAS, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1—is also recommended for nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS because effective targeted agents are available."}

For patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the NCCN NSCLC Panel currently recommends that a minimum of the following biomarkers should be assessed, including ALK rearrangements, BRAF mutations, EGFR mutations, ERBB2 (HER2) mutations, KRAS mutations, METex14 skipping mutations, NTRK1/2/3 fusions, RET rearrangements, ROS1 rearrangements, and PD-L1 expression levels; molecular testing can be considered in those with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. This list of recommended biomarkers has been revised as new oncogenic driver mutations were identified and new agents were approved. The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends molecular testing in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC for EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and for less common EGFR mutations, such as EGFR S768I, L861Q, and G719X. Patients with metastatic NSCLC may have other somatic genomic alterations for which targeted therapies may be available even if they are not FDA approved for NSCLC, such as high-level MET amplifications; these are referred to as emerging biomarkers (see Emerging Biomarkers to Identify Novel Therapies for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).165-170 In 2020, the NCCN Panel deleted TMB as an emerging immune biomarker based on clinical trial data and other issues (see TMB in this Discussion).171 The NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC provide recommendations for individual biomarkers that should be tested and recommend testing techniques but do not endorse any specific commercially available biomarker assays or commercial laboratories.186 Biomarker testing should be done at properly accredited laboratories (minimum of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA] accreditation) (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, KRAS, METex14 skipping mutations, RET rearrangements, and ROS1 rearrangements do not usually overlap; thus, testing for KRAS mutations may identify patients who will not benefit from further molecular testing (also known as tiered testing approaches).185,187-191 The KRAS oncogene is a prognostic biomarker. The presence of KRAS mutations is prognostic of poor survival for patients with NSCLC when compared to the absence of KRAS mutations, independent of therapy (see KRAS Mutations in this Discussion).192 Information about biomarker testing and plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing (so-called \"liquid biopsy\") for actionable mutations is included in the algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Briefly, the panel feels that plasma ctDNA testing should not be used to diagnose NSCLC; tissue should be used to diagnose NSCLC. Standards and guidelines for plasma ctDNA testing for somatic variants/mutations have not been published, there is up to a 30% false-negative rate, and variants can be detected that are not related to the tumor (eg, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential [CHIP]).193,194 For example, an IDH1 mutation identified by plasma ctDNA testing is likely unrelated to NSCLC, given exceptionally low incidence, and is more likely to represent CHIP. Rare examples of CHIP with KRAS mutations have been described, suggesting caution in the interpretation of ctDNA findings.195 In addition, CHIP can be identified following prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, further confounding interpretation of variants such as in TP53.196 Given the previous caveats, MS-13 Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel added a caveat that many, but not all, ctDNA tests use next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based technology. However, plasma ctDNA testing can be used in specific circumstances if 1) the patient is not medically fit for invasive tissue sampling; or 2) there is insufficient tissue for molecular analysis and follow-up tissue-based analysis will be done if an oncogenic driver is not identified. Data suggest that plasma ctDNA testing is a useful minimally invasive test that can be used to identify ALK, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, MET exon 14 skipping, RET, ROS1, and other oncogenic biomarkers that would not otherwise be identified in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Molecular testing of plasma ctDNA should be done using clinically validated tests. Testing for Molecular Biomarkers Molecular testing is used to test for oncogenic genomic driver events for which targeted therapies are available; these somatic genomic alterations (also known as molecular biomarkers) include gene mutations and fusions. Testing for certain biomarkers is also recommended for eligible patients with resectable early-stage and locally advanced NSCLC. The panel defines broad molecular profiling for NSCLC as molecular testing that identifies all of the classic actionable biomarkers described in the algorithm [eg, ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, ROS1]—using either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays—and optimally also identifies the emerging biomarkers (eg, high-level MET amplifications). Tiered KRAS testing approaches, based on the low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers, are acceptable (see KRAS Mutations in this Discussion). Broad genomic profiling may be used to assess for mechanisms of resistance in patients who have had disease progression on targeted therapy. In addition, broad molecular profiling may be used to distinguish separate primary lung cancers from intrapulmonary metastases (see Multiple Lung Cancers in this Discussion). Broad genomic profiling may also help determine eligibility for certain molecularly driven clinical trials. The various testing methods that may be used to assess for the different biomarkers are described in the algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Broad molecular profiling systems may be used to simultaneously test for multiple biomarkers. NGS (also known as massively parallel sequencing) is a type of broad molecular profiling system that can detect panels of mutations and gene fusions if the NGS platforms have been designed and validated to detect these somatic genomic alterations. It is important to recognize that NGS requires quality control as much as any other diagnostic technique; because it is design dependent, the panel of genes and abnormalities detected with NGS will vary depending on the design of the NGS platform. For example, some NGS platforms can detect both mutations and gene fusions, as well as copy number variation, but they are not uniformly present in all NGS assays being conducted either commercially or in institutional laboratories. Other mutation screening assays are available for detecting multiple biomarkers simultaneously, which can detect more than 50 point mutations; NGS platforms can detect even more biomarkers.

Both FDA and laboratory-developed test platforms are available that evaluate these and other analytes. Broad molecular profiling is also recommended to identify emerging biomarkers for which effective therapy may be available, such as high-level MET amplifications. Although clinicopathologic features—such as smoking status, ethnicity, and histology—are associated with specific somatic, disease-associated variants/mutations (eg, EGFR mutations), these features should not be used to select patients for testing. The NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC provide recommendations for individual biomarkers that should be tested and recommend testing techniques, but do not endorse any specific commercially available biomarker assays or commercial laboratories. Several systems are available to classify the pathogenicity of variants. One classification system uses 1) variants with strong clinical significance (Tier I); 2) variants with potential clinical significance (Tier II); 3) variants of unknown clinical significance (Tier III); and 4) variants that are benign or likely benign (Tier IV). Another classification system uses pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely not pathogenic (likely benign), and not pathogenic (benign); this schema is most commonly applied to germline alterations, with some adoption in somatic testing interpretation. Laboratories that adopt either approach (or others) typically do not report alterations that are classified as not pathogenic/Tier IV. Certain molecular testing methods—such as NGS or Sanger—can identify VUS alterations, while targeted assays generally do not detect them. The NCCN Guidelines note that any variant that is classified as VUS should not be used to select targeted therapy even if the VUS occurs in a gene in which other variants are clinically actionable (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). ALK Gene Rearrangements About 5% of patients with NSCLC have ALK gene rearrangements. Patients with ALK rearrangements are resistant to EGFR TKIs but have similar clinical characteristics to those with EGFR mutations, such as adenocarcinoma histology and either a light or never smoking history. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for ALK rearrangements in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, or lorlatinib for ALK rearrangements and on FDA approvals. If patients appear to have squamous cell NSCLC, then ALK testing can be considered because ALK rearrangements also occur in squamous cell NSCLC, although at a lower rate than nonsquamous NSCLC. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel now recommends testing for ALK rearrangements, in addition to EGFR mutations, in eligible patients with resectable early-stage NSCLC (stages IB–IIIA, stage IIIB [only T3,N2]) to assess whether adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab or pembrolizumab is an option. PD-L1 inhibitors are less beneficial in patients with some oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK rearrangements). The different testing methods for ALK rearrangements are described in the algorithm (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A molecular diagnostic FISH test has been approved by the FDA for detecting ALK rearrangements. Rapid prescreening with IHC to assess for ALK rearrangements can be done. An IHC assay for ALK rearrangements has also been approved by the FDA. NGS can also be used to assess whether ALK rearrangements are present, if the platform has been appropriately"}

If an actionable oncogenic genetic variant occurs in a patient, usually only one variant is present. Therefore, tiered approaches may identify patients who will not benefit from further molecular testing (see KRAS Mutations in this Discussion). The NCCN Panel has preference stratified the first-line therapy options for patients with ALK rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC. Alectinib, brigatinib, or lorlatinib are recommended as preferred first-line monotherapy options for patients with ALK rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC (see NSCLC with ALK Rearrangements in this Discussion). Ceritinib is an “other recommended” option, whereas crizotinib is “useful in certain circumstances.” Data suggest that patients with ALK rearrangement–positive metastatic NSCLC do not respond to single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Patients typically have disease progression after first-line therapy with alectinib, brigatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, or lorlatinib; subsequent therapy recommendations are described in the algorithm and often include continuing the first-line targeted therapies, depending on the type of progression [see Second-Line and Beyond (Subsequent) Systemic Therapy in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC]. Patients with ALK rearrangements often have brain metastases after progression on the initial targeted therapies. Treatment of limited brain lesions—clinical trials have included up to 3–5 progressing sites—in patients with NSCLC differs from that recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers, because patients with NSCLC and brain lesions often have long-term survival; therefore, the potential neurocognitive issues that may occur with whole brain RT are a concern. Clinicians are using whole brain RT less often in patients with NSCLC and limited brain lesions. For multiple lesions, whole brain RT is recommended; stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be preferred for patients who have good PS and low systemic tumor burden (see the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers, available at www.NCCN.org). BRAF V600E Mutations BRAF (v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) is a serine/threonine kinase that is part of the MAP/ERK signaling pathway. The BRAF p.V600E mutation occurs in 1% to 2% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma; it is the most common of the BRAF point mutations when considered across all tumor types. Rare BRAF mutations include p.V600K, p.V600D, and other mutations. Patients with BRAF p.V600E mutations typically either currently or previously smoked cigarettes, whereas those with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements typically have never smoked. Mutations in BRAF typically do not overlap with EGFR mutations, METex14 skipping mutations, RET rearrangements, ALK rearrangements, or ROS1 rearrangements. Testing for BRAF mutations is recommended in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. Testing may be considered in patients with metastatic NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma because BRAF mutations also occur in squamous cell NSCLC, although at a lower rate than nonsquamous NSCLC. Real-time PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS are the most commonly used methods to assess for BRAF mutations (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for BRAF mutations in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of dabrafenib plus trametinib for patients with BRAF p.V600E mutations and on FDA approval (see NSCLC with BRAF V600E Mutation in this Discussion).

Molecular testing for EGFR mutations is also recommended for eligible patients with resectable stage IB to IIIA and stage IIIB (only T3,N2) NSCLC to determine whether adjuvant therapy with osimertinib is an option (see Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy: Trial Data and NCCN Recommendations in this Discussion).\nEGFR Exon 19 Deletions and EGFR Exon 21 L858R Mutations\nIn patients with NSCLC, the two most commonly found EGFR gene mutations are deletions in exon 19 (with conserved deletion of the LREA sequence) in 45% of patients with EGFR mutations and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R in 40%). Both mutations result in activation of the tyrosine kinase domain, and both are associated with sensitivity to the small-molecule EGFR TKIs, such as afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and osimertinib (see Targeted Therapies in this Discussion).244 Because these EGFR mutations are sensitive to the EGFR TKIs, they were previously referred to as sensitizing EGFR mutations; however, the specific mutations are now described. These common EGFR mutations are found in approximately 10% of white patients with NSCLC and up to 50% of Asian patients.245 Other less common mutations (approximately 10%), which are also sensitive to EGFR TKIs, include exon 20 p.S768I, exon 21 p.L861Q, and/or exon 18 p.G719X (see EGFR S768I, L861Q, and G719X Mutations in this section and Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).246,247 Data suggest that patients harboring tumors without these specific EGFR mutations should not be treated with EGFR TKIs in any line of therapy, although there are exceptions.\nMost patients with the common EGFR mutations have adenocarcinoma histology and either have never smoked cigarettes or previously lightly smoked. Data suggest that EGFR mutations can occur in patients with adenosquamous carcinoma, which is harder to discriminate from squamous cell carcinoma in small specimens.248 Patients with pure squamous cell carcinoma are less likely to have the common EGFR mutations; those with adenosquamous carcinoma may have mutations.136,137,249 However, smoking status, ethnicity, and histology should not be used in selecting patients for testing. The NCCN Panel recommends that molecular testing be considered in all patients with metastatic NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma because these patients may also have actionable biomarkers, such as EGFR mutations, although at a lower incidence than those with metastatic NSCLC adenocarcinoma.136,137,184,185\nThe predictive effects of the EGFR exon 19 deletions and EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations are well-defined. Patients with these common EGFR mutations have a significantly better response to afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, or osimertinib.244 Data show that EGFR TKI therapy is as effective as first-line monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and common EGFR mutations (see Targeted Therapies in this Discussion).249-254 Progression-free survival (PFS) is longer with use of EGFR TKI monotherapy in patients with the common EGFR mutations when compared with cytotoxic systemic therapy, although overall survival"}

The phrase subsequent therapy is used in these NCCN Guidelines instead of second-line or beyond therapy, because the line of therapy may vary depending on previous treatment with targeted agents.

Acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs may also be associated with histologic transformation from NSCLC to SCLC and with epithelial to mesenchymal transition.276-280 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends that a tissue biopsy should be considered at progression to rule out SCLC transformation (approximately 6%) and to evaluate mechanisms of resistance.277 Acquired resistance can also be mediated by other molecular events, such as acquisition of ALK rearrangement, MET or ERBB2 amplification, and other biomarkers.281 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for EGFR mutations (category 1) and other biomarkers in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS based on data showing the efficacy of afatinib, dacomitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, or osimertinib and on FDA approvals (see NSCLC with EGFR Alterations in this Discussion).18,249-254 Molecular testing can be considered for EGFR mutations and other biomarkers in patients with squamous cell carcinoma as previously described.

Testing for ERBB2 (HER2) mutations can be considered in patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Resources are available to assess whether the ERBB2 (HER2) mutations are oncogenic or likely to be oncogenic (see oncoKB.org). Data suggest that patients with ERBB2 mutations respond to first-line immunotherapy regimens.306 KRAS Mutations KRAS is a G-protein with GTPase activity that is part of the MAP/ERK pathway; point mutations in KRAS most commonly occur at codon 12. Approximately 25% of patients with adenocarcinomas in a North American population have KRAS mutations; KRAS is the most common mutation in this population.118,175,211,307,308 KRAS mutation prevalence is associated with cigarette smoking, unlike many of the other actionable mutations (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements).309 Patients with KRAS mutations appear to have a shorter survival than patients with wild-type KRAS; therefore, KRAS mutations are prognostic biomarkers.182,308,310 KRAS mutations do not generally overlap with EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and ALK genetic variants.185,188-191,311 Therefore, a tiered approach using KRAS testing may identify patients who may not benefit from further molecular biomarker testing.173,204 KRAS mutations may infrequently overlap with EGFR mutations or RET rearrangements.312,313 In patients with KRAS mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC, data suggest the response rate is about 26% for single-agent ICIs.184,314 First-line platinum-based chemotherapy (± immunotherapy) is a recommended option for patients with KRAS mutations (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends testing for KRAS mutations in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on data showing the efficacy of adagrasib or sotorasib as subsequent therapy options for patients with KRAS p.G12C mutations and on FDA approvals (see NSCLC with KRAS G12C Mutations in this Discussion).315-317 Responsiveness to adagrasib or sotorasib has not been assessed for mutations other than KRAS G12C. NGS, real-time PCR, and Sanger sequencing (ideally with tumor enrichment) are the most commonly used methods to assess for KRAS mutations (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). MET Genomic Alterations C-MET, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is involved in cell survival and proliferation; oncogenic driver genomic alterations in MET include METex14 skipping mutations, MET gene copy number (GCN) gain or amplification, and MET protein overexpression.187 MET genomic alterations do not typically overlap with EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, and ALK genetic variants.318 However, METex14 skipping mutations and MET amplification may occur together. METex14 skipping mutations occur in 3% to 4% of patients with adenocarcinoma NSCLC and 1% to 2% of patients with other NSCLC histologies.319,320 METex14 skipping mutations are more frequent in older women who have never smoked cigarettes.321 Several different types of METex14 skipping mutations may occur, such as mutations, base substitutions, and deletions, which makes it difficult to test for all of the mutations. NGS is the primary method of detecting METex14 skipping mutations; RNA-based NGS may have improved"}

The panel also voted that crizotinib or systemic therapy options (such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel) are useful in certain circumstances. NTRK1/2/3 Gene Fusions NTRK gene fusions encode tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion proteins (eg, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC) that act as oncogenic drivers for solid tumors including lung, salivary gland, thyroid, and sarcoma.326-328 A diverse range of solid tumors in children and adults may be caused by NTRK gene fusions (eg, NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3). It is estimated that NTRK1/2/3 fusions occur in 0.2% of patients with NSCLC and do not typically overlap with other oncogenic drivers such as EGFR, ALK, or ROS1.327 Various methods can be used to detect NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions, including NGS, FISH, IHC, and PCR assays (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). NGS testing can detect a broad range of NTRK gene fusions; however, RNA-based NGS may improve detection. DNA-based NGS may not detect some NTRK1 and NTRK3 fusions; RNA-based NGS may be considered to assess for fusions.329 In a clinical trial, NTRK gene fusions were detected with NGS (50 patients) and FISH (5 patients).328 Larotrectinib and entrectinib are oral TKIs that inhibit TRK across a diverse range of solid tumors in patients with NTRK gene–fusion positive disease, regardless of age.328,330 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends NTRK1/2/3 gene fusion testing in patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data showing the efficacy of larotrectinib or entrectinib for patients with NTRK gene fusion–positive disease and on FDA approvals; however, clinical data are limited in NSCLC to support this recommendation (see NSCLC with NTRK Gene Fusion in this Discussion).328,331 RET Rearrangements RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that affects cell proliferation and differentiation. Rearrangements may occur in NSCLC between the RET gene and other domains, especially kinesin family 5B (KIF5B) and coiled coil domain containing-6 (CCDC6), which lead to overexpression of the RET protein.332,333 RET rearrangements occur in about 1% to 2% of patients with NSCLC and are more frequent in patients with adenocarcinoma histology.332-336 In European patients, RET rearrangements occur in individuals who currently smoke cigarettes and those who have never nonsmoked.334 RET rearrangements do not typically overlap with EGFR, ROS1, BRAF, METex14 skipping, and ALK genetic variants.333 However, a few studies suggest that RET rearrangements may infrequently overlap with EGFR or KRAS mutations.312,313 NGS, FISH, and RT-PCR can be used to detect RET rearrangements (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).333 NGS has high specificity; however, RNA-based NGS is preferable to DNA-based NGS for fusion detection.

{"page_number": 143, "title": "page_143", "chinese_summary": "该页面详细介绍了非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）的NCCN指南版本5.2025中关于免疫生物标志物测试的内容，特别是PD-L1表达水平和肿瘤突变负荷（TMB）的相关信息。首先，PD-L1表达水平是评估患者是否适合使用PD-1或PD-L1抑制剂（免疫检查点抑制剂，ICI）的最佳可用生物标志物。PD-L1受体在活化的细胞毒性T细胞上表达，人类ICI抗体通过抑制PD-1受体或PD-L1来增强抗肿瘤免疫。NCCN NSCLC小组建议在所有转移性NSCLC患者开始一线治疗前进行PD-L1表达的IHC测试，以评估ICI方案的适用性。然而，PD-L1表达水平是一个连续变化且动态的指标，因此设定阳性结果的截止值是人为的。不同ICI有不同的抗PD-L1 IHC检测方法，其定义的阳性或阴性结果取决于个体抗体、克隆和平台。其次，TMB作为总 somatic 突变数的近似测量，理论上高TMB水平与高neoantigen水平相关，可激活抗肿瘤免疫反应。吸烟者通常具有较高的TMB水平，而非吸烟者则较低。CHECKMATE 227试验的初步数据显示，TMB可能是决定转移性NSCLC患者是否使用免疫疗法的有用免疫生物标志物，但更新数据显示，无论TMB或PD-L1表达水平如何，nivolumab加ipilimumab都能改善总生存期。此外，TMB与PD-L1表达水平在NSCLC患者中并不相关。KEYNOTE 158试验评估了实体瘤患者接受pembrolizumab作为二线治疗时的TMB水平。总的来说，该指南强调在临床可行的情况下，应在一线ICI治疗前获取可操作生物标志物的分子检测结果，包括ALK、BRAF、EGFR等变异。如果无法进行分子检测，则按无驱动致癌基因处理。对于具有靶向驱动致癌基因分子变异的转移性NSCLC患者，即使PD-L1表达水平为1%或更高，也应首选靶向治疗而非一线ICIs，因为靶向治疗在一线设置中的响应率更高、耐受性更好，且这些患者对单药ICIs的响应可能性较低。", "original_text": "National Comprehensive Cancer Network® NCCN Guidelines Version 5.2025 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Testing for Immune Biomarkers PD-L1 Expression Levels Human ICI antibodies inhibit the PD-1 receptor or PD-L1, which improves antitumor immunity; PD-1 receptors are expressed on activated cytotoxic T cells.358-360 Cemiplimab-rwlc, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1 receptors.138,361,362 Atezolizumab and durvalumab inhibit PD-L1.363,364 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends IHC testing for PD-L1 expression (category 1) ideally before first-line treatment (if clinically feasible) in all patients with metastatic NSCLC to assess whether the ICI regimens are an option based on clinical data showing the efficacy of these regimens (see Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion).138,365 Although it is not an optimal biomarker, PD-L1 expression is currently the best available biomarker to assess whether patients are candidates for PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (also known as ICIs, immuno-oncology [IO] agents, immunotherapy).366,367 PD-L1 expression is continuously variable and dynamic; thus, a cutoff value for a positive result is artificial. Patients with PD-L1 expression levels just below and just above 50% will probably have similar responses.366 Unique anti-PD-L1 IHC assays have been developed for each one of the different ICIs.368,369-370 The definition of a positive or negative PD-L1 test result depends on the individual antibody, clone, and platform, which may be unique to each ICI.370 Extensive effort has been undertaken to examine the cross-comparability of different clones with regard to each other to facilitate adoption of testing. While some clones for PD-L1 are FDA-approved for specific indications, using multiple IHC tests is not necessary if the individual IHC test has been validated against the FDA-approved clone. Testing for PD-L1 is not required for prescribing first-line therapy with certain ICI regimens—such as cemiplimab-rwlc monotherapy or atezolizumab with or without chemotherapy—or for subsequent therapy with single-agent nivolumab or atezolizumab. The NCCN NSCLC Panel emphasizes that clinicians should obtain molecular testing results for actionable biomarkers before administering first-line ICI therapy, if clinically feasible, including ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1 variants. If it is not feasible to do molecular testing, then patients are treated as though they do not have driver oncogenes. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or more—but who also have a targetable driver oncogene molecular variant—should receive first-line targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs, because targeted therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) than ICIs (lower response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted therapy is better tolerated, and these patients are less likely to respond to single-agent ICIs.184,371-374 TMB TMB is an approximate measure of the total number of somatic mutations.375 Theoretically, high TMB levels will correlate with high neoantigen levels that will activate an antitumor immune response.376 TMB levels are typically high in patients with NSCLC who currently or previously smoked cigarettes. Low TMB is more commonly detected in individuals who have never smoked cigarettes.329,377 Preliminary data for PFS from CHECKMATE 227, a phase 3 randomized trial with a complex design, suggested that TMB might be a useful immune biomarker for deciding whether to use immunotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC.378 However, updated data from CHECKMATE 227 showed that overall survival was improved with nivolumab plus ipilimumab regardless of TMB or PD-L1 expression levels.379 In addition, combining TMB with PD-L1 expression level also did not correlate with overall survival. Several trials have shown that high TMB levels do not correlate with PD-L1 expression levels in patients with NSCLC.378-381 KEYNOTE 158, a phase 2 trial, assessed TMB levels in patients with solid tumors who received pembrolizumab as second-line therapy; however, none of the patients had MS-23 Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

In 2020, the NCCN Panel removed TMB as an emerging immune biomarker for patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data, concerns about variable TMB measurements, and other issues as described here.171,375,379 The NCCN Guidelines do not recommend measurement of TMB levels before deciding whether to use nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimens or to use other ICIs, such as pembrolizumab.171 Treatment Approaches Surgery, RT, and systemic therapy are the three modalities most commonly used to treat patients with NSCLC. They can be used either alone or in combination depending on the disease status. In the following sections, the clinical trials are described that have led to the recommended treatments. For tools to aid optimal assessment and care of older adults, see the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology (available at www.NCCN.org). Older adults may be at risk for treatment-related adverse events.383 Surgery In general, surgery provides the best chance for cure in patients with stage I or II disease.384 Thoracic surgical oncology consultation should be part of the evaluation of any patient being considered for curative local therapy. The overall plan of treatment and the necessary imaging studies should be determined before any nonemergency treatment is initiated. It is essential to determine whether patients can tolerate surgery or whether they are medically inoperable; some patients deemed inoperable may be able to tolerate minimally invasive surgery and/or sublobar resection.384-390 Although frailty is an increasingly recognized predictor of surgical and other treatment morbidity, a preferred frailty assessment system has not been established.391-393 The Principles of Surgical Therapy are described in the NSCLC algorithm and are summarized here. Determination of resectability, surgical staging, and pulmonary resection should be performed by thoracic surgeons who should participate in multidisciplinary clinics and/or tumor boards for patients with lung cancer. Surgery may be appropriate for select patients with uncommon types of lung cancer (eg, superior sulcus, chest wall involvement) (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).394 Patients with clinical stage IB or greater disease, or high-risk factors, should be referred to a medical oncologist for evaluation. For patients with stage IIIA NSCLC that is deemed resectable, consider referral to a radiation oncologist. Treatment delays, because of poor coordination among specialists, should be avoided. The surgical procedure used depends on the extent of disease and on the cardiopulmonary reserve of the patient. A preoperative or intraoperative tissue diagnosis of lung cancer should be established before doing a lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy.

Before treatment, it is essential to carefully evaluate for N2 disease using radiologic and invasive staging (ie, EBUS-guided procedures, mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopic procedures) and to discuss whether surgery is appropriate in a multidisciplinary team, which should include a thoracic surgeon.445,446 Randomized controlled trials suggest that surgery does not increase survival in these patients.447,448 However, one of these trials (EORTC) only enrolled patients with unresectable disease.448 Most clinicians agree that resection is appropriate for patients with negative preoperative mediastinal nodes and with a single positive node (<3 cm) found at thoracotomy.449 Neoadjuvant (also known as preoperative or induction) systemic therapy is recommended for select patients with resectable NSCLC (see Combined Modality Therapy in this Discussion).\n\nThe optimal timing of RT in trimodality therapy (preoperative with chemotherapy or postoperative) is not established and is controversial.450-452 Adding RT to induction regimens for patients with stage IIIA (N2) disease has been associated with higher pathological response but similar overall survival when compared with using preoperative chemotherapy (generally followed by postoperative RT).452 For patients with completely resected stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, data from the LungART and PORT-C trials show that postoperative RT (also known as PORT) did not improve survival compared with no postoperative RT, although locoregional control was significantly improved.450,453 Postoperative RT may be considered for select patients with negative margins and high-risk N2 disease (see Chemoradiation in this Discussion and Principles of Radiation Therapy in the algorithm). It is controversial whether pneumonectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is appropriate.447,454-460 Clinicians also agree that resection is not appropriate for patients with multiple pathologically proven malignant lymph nodes greater than 3 cm; definitive chemoradiotherapy is recommended for these patients. Patients with resectable stage IIIA (N2) disease should not be excluded from surgery, because some of them may have long-term survival or may be cured.455,461\n\nThe NCCN NSCLC Panel believes that surgery may be appropriate for select patients with N2 disease.445,455,462 The NCCN Member Institutions were surveyed in 2021 regarding their approach to patients with N2 disease (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For example, more institutions now use neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with N2 disease. Many (66%) of the NCCN Member Institutions use induction chemotherapy, whereas 33% use induction chemoradiation.463,464 Before surgery, most institutions require at least stable disease after induction therapy but do not require radiologic or pathologic response. All NCCN institutions consider surgery for single-station non-bulky N2 disease.

Whole brain RT and SRS for brain metastases are also discussed in this section. The RT abbreviations are defined in the NSCLC algorithm (see Table 1 in Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised some of the RT recommendations in the algorithm (see Summary of the Guidelines Updates and Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For example, recommendations about postoperative RT have been revised based on clinical trial data.450,453,471-475 General Principles Treatment recommendations should be made by a multidisciplinary team. Because RT has a potential role in all stages of NSCLC, as either definitive or palliative therapy, input from radiation oncologists who perform lung cancer RT as a prominent part of their practice should be part of the multidisciplinary evaluation for all patients with NSCLC. RT recommendations for NSCLC include: 1) definitive therapy for locally advanced NSCLC, generally combined with chemotherapy; 2) definitive therapy for early-stage NSCLC in patients with contraindications for surgery; 3) neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy (also known as preoperative or postoperative therapy) for selected patients treated with surgery; 4) therapy for limited progression; and/or 5) palliative therapy for patients with incurable NSCLC.408,450,453,476-483 The goals of RT are to maximize tumor control and to minimize treatment toxicity. Advanced technologies such as 4D-CT simulation, intensity-modulated RT/volumetric modulated arc therapy (IMRT/VMAT), image-guided RT (IGRT), motion management strategies, and proton therapy have been shown to reduce toxicity and increase survival in nonrandomized trials.472,484-486 A secondary analysis of the RTOG 0617 randomized trial reported that 2-year overall survival, PFS, local failure, and distant metastasis-free survival were not significantly different for IMRT when compared with older 3D-conformal RT (3D-CRT) technique despite higher tumor burden in patients treated with IMRT. However, IMRT yielded lower rates of severe pneumonitis compared with 3D-CRT (3.5% vs. 7.9%; P = .039).491 CT-planned 3D-CRT is now considered to be the minimum technological standard, with IMRT preferred. Radiation Simulation, Planning, and Delivery Simulation should be performed using CT scans obtained in the RT treatment position. Intravenous contrast CT scans, with or without oral contrast, are recommended for better target delineation whenever possible, especially in patients with central tumors or nodal involvement. FDG PET/CT can significantly improve target delineation accuracy, especially when there is atelectasis or contraindications to intravenous CT contrast.492,493 Ideally, target delineation should be based on PET/CT that is obtained no more than 4 weeks before treatment because of the potential for rapid progression of NSCLC.494,495 In the NSCLC algorithm, recommendations are provided for patients receiving chemoradiation (including those with compromised lung or cardiac function), photon beams, or IMRT (see the Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).488,496-499 Respiratory motion should be managed.

The QUANTEC review provides the most comprehensive estimates from clinical data of dose-response relationships for normal tissue complications.512-516 The normal tissue dose constraints for conventionally fractionated RT are based on a survey of radiation oncologists at NCCN Member Institutions (see Table 5 in Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).473,517-522 These constraints are mainly empirical and have not, for the most part, been validated rigorously.501,521,523-528 Therefore, the doses and constraints provided in the tables are not specific prescriptive recommendations; they are useful reference doses that have been commonly used or are from previous clinical trials. A caveat was also added that these constraints represent doses that generally should not be exceeded. Because the risk of toxicity increases progressively with dose to normal tissues, a key principle of radiation treatment planning is to keep normal tissue doses \"as low as reasonably achievable\" while adequately covering the target. The doses to any given organ at risk should typically be lower than these constraints, approaching them only when there is close proximity to the target volume. After surgery, lung tolerance to RT is much less than for patients with intact lungs; therefore, more conservative constraints should be used for postoperative RT. For definitive RT, the commonly prescribed dose is 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions over 6 to 7 weeks (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).529,530 RTOG 0617, a phase 3 randomized trial, suggests that high-dose radiation using 74 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy does not improve survival, and might be harmful, when compared with a dose of 60 Gy.518,531-535 In this trial and subsequent retrospective analyses, higher dose to the heart and specific cardiac substructures, such as the coronary arteries, was associated with increased mortality.535-541 Although optimal RT dose intensification remains a valid question, the NCCN Panel does not currently recommend a high dose of 74 Gy for routine use.532,534,535,537-545 General Treatment Information The RT recommendations for patients with stages I to IV are described in the NSCLC algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Definitive RT, preferably SABR, is recommended for patients with early-stage NSCLC (ie, stage I–II, N0) who are medically inoperable or those who refuse surgery (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion).404,405,408,483,546,547 SABR is also an option for patients at high surgical risk who cannot tolerate a lobectomy because of a major medical comorbidity and/or severely limited lung function. After definitive RT (preferably SABR), adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered in patients with high-risk factors for recurrence (eg, large tumor size), similar to the postoperative setting.406,548-550 Image-guided thermal ablation (eg, cryotherapy, microwave, radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) is an option for selected patients who are medically inoperable and will not receive SABR or definitive RT (see Principles of Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).384,551-557 Resection is recommended for patients with early-stage NSCLC who are medically fit Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

In patients with clinical stage I or II NSCLC who are upstaged to N2+ after surgery, postoperative chemotherapy can be administered, with concurrent postoperative RT for patients with positive margins, or followed by postoperative RT in selected patients with high-risk features. Definitive chemoradiation is recommended for patients with stage II to III disease who are not appropriate surgical candidates.559 For patients with locally advanced NSCLC (stage III), the most commonly prescribed conventionally fractionated doses for definitive RT are 60 to 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. Doses of at least 60 Gy should be given.560 Involved-field RT (also known as involved-field irradiation or IFI) is recommended for treating nodal disease in patients with locally advanced NSCLC (over the older standard of elective nodal irradiation, or ENI).561-568 The optimal care of patients with potentially operable stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC is controversial and is discussed in detail in the algorithm (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).445,447,452,459,569 Before surgical resection of stage IIIA NSCLC, induction systemic therapy or induction chemoradiotherapy is recommended to potentially shrink the tumor(s).452,463 Preoperative systemic therapy and postoperative RT is an option for patients with resectable stage IIIA NSCLC with minimal N2 disease who can be treated with lobectomy.451,464 Preoperative concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for resectable superior sulcus tumors and is an option for other resectable stage IIA to IIIA NSCLC.503 In a 2021 survey of the NCCN Member Institutions, we found that 66% use induction chemotherapy, whereas 33% use induction chemoradiation before surgery for patients with stage IIIA N2 disease.463,464 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends a preoperative RT dose of 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions over 5 weeks.451,570 Definitive RT doses delivered as preoperative chemo/RT can safely be administered and achieve promising nodal clearance and survival rates;504-506,571 the risk of surgical complications after high-dose RT can be minimized with expert thoracic surgical techniques. About 50% of NCCN Member Institutions would consider pneumonectomy after preoperative chemotherapy, whereas only 25% do not consider pneumonectomy absolutely contraindicated after preoperative induction chemoradiation. Surgery is associated with potentially greater risk of complications, particularly stump breakdown and bronchopleural fistula, in a field that has had high-dose RT (eg, 60 Gy). Thus, surgeons are often wary of resection in areas that have previously received RT doses of more than 45 to 50 Gy, especially in patients who have received definitive doses of preoperative concurrent chemoradiation (ie, ≥60 Gy). Soft tissue flap coverage and reduced intraoperative fluid administration and ventilator pressures can reduce the risk of these complications.504-506 When giving preoperative RT to less than definitive doses (eg, 45 Gy), one should be prepared up front to continue to a full definitive dose of RT without interruption if the patient does not proceed to surgery for some reason. For these reasons, when considering trimodality therapy, the treatment plan—including assessment for resectability and the type of resection—should be decided before initiation of any therapy. In postoperative RT, the clinical target volume (CTV) includes the bronchial stump and high-risk draining lymph node stations.572 Standard RT doses after complete resection are 50 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions over 5 to 6 weeks, but a boost may be considered to high-risk regions including areas of nodal extracapsular extension or microscopic positive margins.467,573,574 Lung dose constraints should be more conservative, because tolerance appears to be reduced after surgery.

Definitive local therapy to oligometastases (including brain and lung) achieves prolonged survival in a small proportion of well-selected patients with PS 0 to 2 who have also received radical therapy to the intrathoracic disease.584 Definitive RT to oligometastases, particularly SABR, is an appropriate option in such cases if it can be delivered safely to the involved sites.585,586 In two randomized phase II trials, significantly longer PFS was found for local consolidative therapy (RT or surgery) to primary and oligometastatic lesions versus maintenance systemic therapy or observation for patients not progressing on systemic therapy.587,588 Updated data from one of the trials also show that median overall survival was longer for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who received local consolidative therapy (median, 41.2 months; 95% CI, 18.9 months–not reached) compared with those receiving maintenance therapy or observation (median, 17.0 months; 95% CI, 10.1–39.8 months; P = .017).589 A phase 2 trial of consolidative RT for oligometastatic NSCLC (n = 29) reported median overall survival of 28.4 months (95% CI, 14.5–45.8 months).590 The NCCN Guidelines recommend that local therapy (RT, SABR, or surgery) to primary and oligometastatic lesions should be considered for patients without progression on systemic therapy.587-589\nStereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy\nSABR (also known as SBRT) uses short courses of highly conformal and dose-intensive (ablative) RT precisely delivered to limited-size targets.404,591-594 SABR has achieved good primary tumor control rates and overall survival that is higher than conventionally fractionated RT.404 Studies, including prospective multi-institutional trials, have demonstrated the efficacy of SABR for patients with inoperable stage I NSCLC or for those who refuse surgery.408,595-599 With conventionally fractionated RT, 3-year survival is only about 20% to 35% in these patients, with local failure rates of about 40% to 60%.405 In prospective clinical trials, local control and overall survival appear to be considerably increased with SABR, generally more than 85%, and about 60% at 3 years (median survival, 4 years), respectively, in patients who are medically inoperable.384,405,499,557,558,598,600-605 A 7-year follow-up of 65 patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC reported that overall survival rates were 55.7% at 5 years and 47.5% at 7 years.546 In 12 patients (18.5%), a second primary lung carcinoma developed after SABR at a median of 35 months (range, 5–67 months); 27% (18/65) had disease recurrence a median of 14.5 months (range, 4.3–71.5 months) after SABR."}

SABR can also be used for patients with limited lung metastases or limited metastases to other body sites.592,599,607-613 SABR is recommended in the NSCLC algorithm for patients with stage I and II (T1-3,N0,M0) NSCLC who are medically inoperable; SABR is a reasonable alternative to surgery for patients with potentially operable disease who are high risk, older, or refuse surgery after appropriate consultation (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).384,599,601,606,614 If possible, biopsy should confirm NSCLC before use of SABR.404,615,616 Decisions about whether to recommend SABR should be based on multidisciplinary discussion. If therapy is contemplated based on a clinical diagnosis without tissue confirmation of NSCLC, then multidisciplinary evaluation is required to provide consensus on the risk-benefit ratio of biopsy and/or the clinical diagnosis.617,618 By analogy with surgical treatment, adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered after definitive RT, preferably SABR, in patients with high-risk factors for recurrence (eg, large tumor size).406,548-550 Locoregional recurrences can occur after SABR.558,597,619-624 Late recurrences have been reported more than 5 years after SABR, highlighting the need for careful surveillance.525,626 After SABR, assessment of recurrences by imaging can be challenging because of benign inflammatory/fibrotic changes that can remain FDG-PET avid for 2 or more years after treatment, emphasizing the importance of follow-up by a team with experience interpreting such post-treatment effects.627,628 This careful follow-up is particularly relevant, because selected patients with recurrences after SABR may benefit from surgery or re-treatment with SABR.625,629-633 SABR fractionation regimens and a limited subset of historically used maximum dose constraints are provided in the NSCLC algorithm; 1 to 5 fractions are generally used (see Tables 2 and 3 in the Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).404,596,598,605,634-644 In the United States, only regimens of 5 fractions or less meet the arbitrary billing code definition for SBRT; however, slightly more protracted ablative regimens are also appropriate.644,645 Prescription doses do not completely describe the actual delivered doses.646,647 These maximum dose constraints are for reference and are not intended to be prescriptive; they are used commonly or have been used in clinical trials. Although none of these dose constraints has been validated as a maximally tolerated dose, outcomes of clinical trials to date suggest that they are safe constraints. The bronchial tree, esophagus, and brachial plexus are critical structures for SABR. For centrally located tumors—defined variably as within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tree and/or abutting mediastinal pleura—regimens of 54 to 60 Gy in 3 fractions are not safe and should be avoided; 4- to 10-fraction SABR regimens appear to be effective and safe (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).406,637,648-650 The RTOG 0813 trial evaluated 5-fraction regimens and found no high-grade toxicities at 50 Gy in 5 fractions.651,652 Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

Image-guided thermal ablation (ie, cryotherapy, microwave, radiofrequency) may be an option for selected patients who will not be receiving SABR or definitive RT.384,408,557 Whole Brain RT and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Many patients with NSCLC have brain metastases (30%-50%), which substantially affect their quality of life.664,665 Control of brain metastases preserves neurocognitive function.666,667 However, whole brain RT is itself associated with measurable declines in neurocognitive function in clinical trials, particularly with increasing dose and advanced age of the patient.668-670 For limited brain metastases, randomized trials have found that the addition of whole brain RT to SRS decreases intracranial recurrence but does not improve survival and may increase the risk of cognitive decline.667,671 Thus, SRS alone is recommended for patients with limited brain metastases.237 A randomized trial assessed cognitive function in 213 patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases who received SRS alone versus SRS with whole brain RT; most patients had lung cancer.236 At 3 months after SRS alone, patients had less cognitive deterioration (40/63 patients [63.5%]) than those receiving SRS plus whole brain RT (44/48 patients [91.7%]; difference, -28.2%; 90% CI, -41.9% to -14.4%; P < .001). Resection followed by SRS to the cavity (instead of resection followed by whole brain RT) may decrease the risk of neurocognitive impairment.672,673 A randomized trial demonstrated that using IMRT to avoid the hippocampus decreases memory impairment after whole brain RT.674 A phase 3 randomized trial assessed optimal supportive care (including dexamethasone) with whole brain RT versus optimal supportive care alone in patients with NSCLC and brain metastases who were not eligible for brain surgery or SRS.675 Overall survival was similar between the groups (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90–1.26). Overall quality of life, use of dexamethasone, and reported adverse events were also similar between the arms.

SABR can be considered for patients with medically inoperable or high-risk stage I (T1–3,N0) disease or those who refuse surgery if their disease is node negative (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion and see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with completely resected NSCLC, adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in patients with early-stage disease.589-692 Some studies suggest that preoperative chemotherapy (also referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy or induction chemotherapy) is as effective as and better tolerated than postoperative chemotherapy (see Preoperative Chemotherapy With or Without Immunotherapy Followed by Surgery in this Discussion).445,693-699 A randomized trial found no difference in survival with preoperative versus postoperative chemotherapy.700 The NCCN Guidelines state that patients with stage II or IIIA (T3,N1) disease may be treated with induction systemic therapy before surgery if they would have been candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery.384,701 Concurrent chemoradiation is more efficacious than sequential chemoradiation for patients with unresectable stage III disease.702-705 Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents can cause hair loss, which is distressing for patients. Hair loss varies depending on the systemic regimen and other factors. Data in women with non-metastatic breast cancer suggest that a scalp cooling device may help reduce hair loss in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens.706-710 For patients with stage IV disease who have a good PS, platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy is beneficial.711-718 Data show that early palliative care combined with systemic therapy improved quality of life, mood, and survival in patients with metastatic NSCLC, even if these patients had less aggressive end-of-life care, when compared with those receiving systemic therapy alone.719,720 Patients should receive treatment for debilitating symptoms.664,721,722 A study also suggests that social support, such as being married, is as effective as systemic therapy.723 Data suggest that systematic symptom monitoring during outpatient chemotherapy treatment increases overall survival when compared with usual care.724-726 Surgery is rarely recommended for patients with stage IV disease. However, surgical resection of limited brain progression may improve survival in selected patients with stage IV disease and is recommended for selected patients in the NCCN Guidelines (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).727 Definitive local therapy with surgical resection or RT is recommended for limited single-organ progression located in sites other than the brain if definitive thoracic therapy is feasible (see Stage IVA, M1b in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).394,584,587,589,599,653,654 The trials supporting the recommendations for combined modality therapy are discussed in the following sections. Surgery Followed by Adjuvant Therapy Chemotherapy The International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT) assessed cisplatin-based postoperative therapy in patients with completely resected stage I, II, or III NSCLC.990 The study included 1867 patients with surgically resected lung cancer who were randomly assigned either to cisplatin-based postoperative chemotherapy or to observation, with a median follow-up duration of 56 months. The survival rate at 5 years was 45% for cisplatin-based therapy versus 40% for observation (HR for death, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.98; P < .03); the disease-free survival rate was 39% versus 34% at 5 years (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.94; P < .003).

In the JBR.10 trial, 482 patients (ECOG PS of 0–1) with completely resected stage IB (T2a,N0) or stage II (T1,N1, or T2,N1) NSCLC were randomly assigned either to vinorelbine plus cisplatin or to observation.691 Postoperative chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall survival compared with observation alone (94 vs. 73 months; HR for death, 0.69; P = .04) and relapse-free survival (not reached vs. 47 months, HR for recurrence, 0.60; P < .001). The 5-year survival rates were 69% and 54%, respectively (P = .03). When compared with observation alone, postoperative chemotherapy was beneficial for patients with stage II disease but not for stage IB disease as shown by updated data from JBR.10 after 9 years of follow-up.729 In patients with stage II disease receiving postoperative chemotherapy, median survival was 6.8 versus 3.6 years in those who were only observed. Of note, patients receiving chemotherapy did not have an increased death rate. In the ANITA trial, 840 patients with stage IB (T2a,N0), II, or IIIA NSCLC were randomly assigned either to postoperative vinorelbine plus cisplatin or to observation.692 Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were manageable in the chemotherapy group; seven toxic deaths were reported. After a median follow-up of 76 months, median survival was 66 months in the chemotherapy group and 44 months in the observation group.692 Postoperative chemotherapy significantly improved (8.6%) the 5-year overall survival in patients with completely resected stage II and IIIA disease, although no benefit was observed in stage I. Some clinicians consider vinorelbine plus cisplatin to be the preferred regimen for completely resected early-stage NSCLC based on the number of trials and the amount of use;730 however, most clinicians in the United States prefer to use regimens with less toxicity.731,732 A meta-analysis of 4584 patients (LACE) found that postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy increased survival over 5 years (absolute benefit of 5.4%); there was no difference among the chemotherapy regimens (vinorelbine, etoposide, and others).733 A subgroup analysis found that cisplatin plus vinorelbine also increased survival.730 The benefit was greater in patients with stage II and III disease and with good PS. Postoperative chemotherapy benefited older patients up to 80 years of age.389,734 The CALGB 9633 trial assessed paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with stage IB (T2a,N0,M0) lung cancer.735-737 In this trial, 344 patients were randomly assigned either to paclitaxel plus carboplatin or to observation (within 4–8 weeks of resection) with a median follow-up duration of 74 months. Postoperative chemotherapy was well tolerated with no chemotherapy-related toxic deaths. Overall survival at 6 years was not significantly different (however, a subset analysis showed a benefit for tumors ≥4 cm), although 3-year survival was significant (80% vs. 73%, P=.02).736,737 Thus, the carboplatin and paclitaxel regimen is only recommended for early-stage disease if patients cannot tolerate cisplatin (see Perioperative Systemic Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).738 It is important to note that the CALGB trial was underpowered for patients with stage 1B disease.739 TREAT, a phase 2 randomized study, assessed cisplatin plus pemetrexed versus cisplatin plus vinorelbine as postoperative therapy for patients with completely resected stages IB to III NSCLC.731 Data showed that cisplatin plus pemetrexed was an effective, less toxic regimen compared with cisplatin plus vinorelbine; in addition, patients were able to receive more cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed compared with cisplatin plus vinorelbine.731 Overall survival at 3 years was similar between the arms (75% vs. 77%; P = .858).740 Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

Recommended chemotherapy regimens for preoperative and postoperative (perioperative) chemotherapy for patients with completely resected stages IB to III NSCLC are provided in the NCCN Guidelines; the regimens also include specific dosing (see Perioperative Systemic Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).689,741 The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified all the systemic therapy regimens and decided that cisplatin plus pemetrexed is the preferred neoadjuvant or adjuvant option for nonsquamous NSCLC if patients are not candidates for ICIs (see Perioperative Systemic Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).731,740 Cisplatin plus gemcitabine or cisplatin plus docetaxel are the preferred perioperative chemotherapy options for patients with squamous cell NSCLC.742,743 Other recommended options include cisplatin plus vinorelbine or cisplatin plus etoposide.690-692 Perioperative therapy options for patients who are not candidates for cisplatin-based therapy are preference stratified as useful in certain circumstances and include: 1) carboplatin plus paclitaxel; 2) carboplatin plus gemcitabine; and 3) carboplatin plus pemetrexed (but only for nonsquamous NSCLC).744-747 Neoadjuvant therapy is also known as preoperative (or induction) therapy; adjuvant therapy is also known as postoperative therapy. Targeted Therapy ADAURA, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adjuvant therapy with osimertinib versus placebo in 682 patients with resected stage IB to IIIA EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.748 At 24 months, 89% (95% CI, 85%–92%) of the osimertinib group and 52% (95% CI, 46%–58%) of the placebo group were alive and disease-free (overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.20; 99.12% CI, 0.14–0.30; P < .001). At 24 months, 98% (95% CI, 95%–99%) of the osimertinib group and 85% (95% CI, 80%–89%) of the placebo group were alive and did not have CNS disease (overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10–0.33). For patients with stage IB NSCLC, 88% (95% CI, 78%–94%) of the osimertinib group and 71% (95% CI, 60%–80%) of the placebo group were alive and disease-free at 24 months (overall HR for disease recurrence or death, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18–0.76). For patients with stage II NSCLC, 91% (95% CI, 82%–95%) of the osimertinib group and 56% (95% CI, 45%–65%) of the placebo group were alive and disease-free at 24 months (overall HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.08–0.31). For those with stage IIIA NSCLC, 88% (95% CI, 79%–94%) of the osimertinib group and 32% (95% CI, 23%–41%) of the placebo group were alive and disease-free at 24 months (overall HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07–0.20). Data were also reported for those who received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not; 60% (410/682) of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy.749 Overall survival data are not yet available. Serious adverse events were reported in 16% (54/339) of patients receiving osimertinib versus 12% (42/343) receiving placebo. Ten patients (3%) receiving osimertinib had interstitial lung disease versus no patients in the placebo group. There were no deaths in the osimertinib group versus one in the placebo group. The NCCN Panel recommends osimertinib as an adjuvant therapy option for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IB to IIIA, and stage IIIB (only T3,N2) EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy or are ineligible to receive platinum-based chemotherapy based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.748 Osimertinib is recommended in this setting for EGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, which are the most common EGFR mutations.

Immunotherapy Trial Data IMpower010, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adjuvant therapy with atezolizumab versus best supportive care in 1005 patients with resected early-stage NSCLC and various PD-L1 levels who had received adjuvant chemotherapy.750 In patients with resected stage II to IIIA NSCLC and PD-L1 of 1% or more, disease-free survival was improved in those receiving adjuvant atezolizumab compared with best supportive care (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.5–0.88; P = .0039). Treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported in 11% (53/495) of patients; 4 deaths occurred (1%, 4/495). Atezolizumab is an ICI that inhibits PD-L1 receptors. PEARLS/KEYNOTE 091, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab versus placebo in 1177 patients with completely resected stage IB to IIIA NSCLC (based on AJCC 7th edition).751 Most patients (86%) received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy after resection but had not received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy after resection, the median disease-free survival was 53.6 months (95% CI, 39.2–not reached) in those receiving adjuvant pembrolizumab compared with 42.0 months (95% CI, 31.3–not reached) in those receiving placebo (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91). Grade 3 or worse events included hypertension (6%) and pneumonia (2%). In patients receiving pembrolizumab, there were four fatal (1%) treatment-related adverse reactions, including myocarditis and cardiogenic shock, septic shock and myocarditis, pneumonia, and sudden death. Pembrolizumab is an ICI that inhibits PD-1 receptors. NCCN Recommendations The NCCN Panel recommends atezolizumab as an adjuvant therapy option for eligible patients with completely resected (R0) stage IIB to IIIA, stage IIIB (only T3,N2), or high-risk stage IIA NSCLC and with PD-L1 of 1% or more who are negative for certain biomarkers—EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, and ALK rearrangements—and who have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.750 For the 2023 update (Version 2), the NCCN Panel added a recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab for eligible patients with completely resected stage IIB to IIIA, stage IIIB (only T3,N2), or high-risk stage IIA NSCLC who are negative for EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK fusions and who have previously received adjuvant chemotherapy.751 The panel added a caveat that the benefit of adjuvant pembrolizumab is unclear for patients with PD-L1 levels less than 1%. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel expanded the molecular testing criteria to include ALK rearrangements because patients with ALK rearrangements, EGFR exon 19 deletions, or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations have less benefit from ICIs.184 Clinical trials are assessing whether ALK inhibitors are effective in this setting.752-758 The NSCLC Panel also clarified that single-agent therapy with osimertinib is recommended if patients have both EGFR mutations and PD-L1 of 1% or more; the panel does not recommend using single-agent therapy with atezolizumab or combination therapy with osimertinib plus atezolizumab in this setting. The NCCN Panel also added a recommendation that patients should be evaluated for perioperative (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) therapy before surgery. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel"}

In the postoperative setting, significant comorbidities and incomplete recovery after surgery often make it difficult for patients to tolerate systemic therapy. This problem was demonstrated in NATCH, a phase 3 randomized trial—which compared surgery alone to preoperative or postoperative chemotherapy with paclitaxel/carboplatin—because 90% of the preoperative cohort completed 3 cycles of chemotherapy but only 61% of the postoperative cohort completed chemotherapy; however, survival was equivalent among all three arms.698 IFCT 0002, a randomized trial, found no difference in 3-year overall survival (67.4% vs. 67.7%) with preoperative versus postoperative chemotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC; response rate and quality of life were similar in both arms.700\nSeveral trials suggest that preoperative therapy is beneficial in patients with N2 disease.445,452,697 Other trials suggest that preoperative therapy is beneficial in patients with earlier stage disease.694,695,699 A randomized intergroup trial (SWOG 9900) evaluated preoperative paclitaxel plus carboplatin in 354 patients with stage IB to IIIA (but not N2) disease versus surgery alone. The trial closed prematurely because of practice changes and was therefore not appropriately powered. This SWOG trial did show a trend toward improved PFS (33 vs. 20 months) and overall survival (62 vs. 41 months) with preoperative chemotherapy, and no difference in resection rates between the two arms.699\nScagliotti et al published a phase 3 trial of preoperative cisplatin plus gemcitabine versus surgery alone in 270 patients with stage IB to IIIA disease. Although the trial closed early, a significant survival benefit was seen in patients with stages IIB and IIIA disease who received preoperative chemotherapy (HR, 0.63).694 Song et al published a meta-analysis of 13 randomized clinical trials evaluating preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone in resectable NSCLCs (overall survival: HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.92; P = .0001).693 These results are similar to those reported in another meta-analysis (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98; P = .02).694 The benefit from preoperative chemotherapy is similar to that attained with postoperative chemotherapy.694,698,700,733\nCheckMate 816, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in 358 patients with resectable (tumors ≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC (stage IB–IIIA resectable NSCLC using AJCC staging, 7th edition).107 Chemotherapy regimens included 1) cisplatin plus either pemetrexed (nonsquamous only) or gemcitabine (squamous only); or 2) carboplatin plus paclitaxel (any histology). If their patients could not tolerate cisplatin, clinicians could substitute carboplatin-based regimens. Patients had good PS (0–1) and did not have EGFR or ALK alterations. The median event-free survival was 31.6 months (95% CI, 30.2–not reached) for nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 20.8 months (95% CI, 14.0–26.7) for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.63; 97% CI, 0.43–0.91; P=.005). The pathologic complete response was 24% (95% CI, 18%–31%) with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 2.2% (95% CI, 0.6%–5.6%) with chemotherapy alone (odds ratio 13.9; 99% CI, 3.49–55.7; P<.001). The major pathologic response was 36.9% with nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 8.9% with chemotherapy alone (major pathologic response, ≤10% viable tumor in lung and lymph nodes).

Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 33.5% of patients receiving nivolumab plus chemotherapy versus 36.9% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.\nNADIM, a single-arm phase 2 study, assessed neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab plus paclitaxel plus carboplatin in 46 patients with surgically resectable stage IIIA NSCLC; 41 patients had resection.759,760 At 36 months, updated results show that overall survival was 81.9% (95% CI, 66.8%-90.6%).759 TMB and PD-L1 levels were not predictive of survival. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 30% (14/46) of patients including increased lipase (3/46, 7%) and febrile neutropenia (3/46, 7%). None of the adverse events were associated with death or delays in surgery.\nNCCN Recommendations\nBased on clinical trial data, the NCCN Panel recommends that certain patients who are likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy may instead be treated with preoperative (also known as induction or neoadjuvant) systemic therapy after surgical evaluation.694,698,700,733 The NCCN Panel recommends nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy as a neoadjuvant systemic therapy option for eligible patients with resectable (tumors ≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC and no contraindications to treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.107,760 For the 2023 update (Version 1), the panel added a recommendation that all patients should be evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy with strong consideration for those with node-positive disease or tumors 4 cm or more and no contraindications for ICIs. However, neoadjuvant therapy should not be used to attempt to induce resectability in patients who do not already meet criteria for resectability on initial evaluation. Some oncogenic drivers—such as EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, or ALK rearrangements—have been shown to be associated with less benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.184 Testing for PD-L1 status, EGFR mutations, and ALK rearrangements is recommended before administering neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy in eligible patients with stage IB (only tumors = 4 cm) to IIIA, or stage IIIB (only T3, N2) NSCLC. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel expanded the criteria to include patients with stage IIIB (only T3,N2) NSCLC as previously described. The chemotherapy regimens that may be used with neoadjuvant nivolumab include: 1) cisplatin plus either pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), gemcitabine (squamous only), or paclitaxel (any histology); or 2) carboplatin plus either pemetrexed (nonsquamous only), gemcitabine (squamous only), or paclitaxel (any histology).107\nChemoradiation\nThe major controversies in NSCLC relate to the care of patients with stage IIIA disease (see the Role of Surgery in Patients with Stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC in Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). All three treatment modalities—surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation—may be used when treating stage III disease. The ongoing debate centers on which modalities to use and in what sequence.761-766\nTwo randomized trials assessed postoperative RT in patients with clinical stage I or II disease that was upstaged surgically to N2.450,453 LungART, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed postoperative RT versus no postoperative RT in 501 patients with completely resected stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who had received either neoajuvant (14%) or adjuvant chemotherapy (75%).450 The median disease-free survival was 30.5 months (95% CI, 24–49) in the postoperative RT group versus 22.8 months (95% CI, 17–37) in the control group (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.68–1.08; P = .18).

Late-grade 3 to 4 cardiopulmonary toxicity occurred in 11% (26/241) of patients in the postoperative RT group versus 5% (12/246) in the control group. Three patients died in the postoperative RT group (2, pneumonitis; 1, sepsis). PORT-C, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed postoperative RT versus no postoperative RT in 394 patients with completely resected stage IIIA (N2) NSCLC who had received adjuvant chemotherapy. The 3-year disease-free survival rates were 40.5% with postoperative RT versus 32.7% with no RT (median, 22.1 vs. 18.6 months) (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65–1.09; P = .20). The 3-year overall survival rates were 78.3% in patients receiving postoperative RT versus 82.8% with no RT (HR, 1.02; P = .93). The 3-year local recurrence only rates were 9.5% and 18.3%, respectively (Fine-Gray HR, 0.55; Gray test P = .04). No radiotherapy-related grade 4 or 5 adverse events were reported. Data from the LungART and PORT-C trials show that postoperative RT (also known as PORT) did not improve survival compared with no postoperative RT, although locoregional control was significantly improved. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN Panel clarified that postoperative RT may be considered for select patients with high-risk N2 disease such as extracapsular extension, multi-station involvement, inadequate lymph node dissection or sampling, and/or refusal of or intolerance to adjuvant systemic therapy. To minimize potential lung and heart toxicities, highly conformal RT techniques such as IMRT or proton therapy are preferred. For patients with unresectable stage IIIA or stage IIIB disease, combined modality therapy (chemoradiation) is more efficacious than RT alone. Concurrent chemoradiation is more efficacious than sequential chemoradiation. However, concurrent chemoradiation has a higher rate of grade 3 or 4 esophagitis than sequential chemoradiation. Selection of patients should be based not only on the anticipated response to therapy but also on how well the patient is anticipated to tolerate therapy. Accelerated RT regimens may be useful if concurrent chemoradiation would not be tolerated. Sequential chemoradiation or RT alone is recommended for frail patients who cannot tolerate concurrent chemoradiation. JCOG0301, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed chemoradiation using low-dose carboplatin versus RT alone in patients (>70 years) with unresectable NSCLC. Median overall survival was 22.4 months (95% CI, 16.5–33.6) for chemoradiation with carboplatin and 16.9 months (95% CI, 13.4–20.3) for RT alone (HR, 0.68; 95.4% CI, 0.47–0.98; P=.0179). In the chemoradiation group, 3% (3/100) of patients died, whereas 4% (4/100) of patients died in the RT group. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic effects occurred at a greater rate in the chemoradiation arm than in the RT alone arm, including leucopenia (61 [63.5%] vs. none), neutropenia (55 [57.3%] vs. none), and thrombocytopenia (28 [29.2%] vs. 2 [2.0%]). In older patients receiving chemoradiation versus RT alone, long-term follow-up data for overall survival continue to support using chemoradiation (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55–0.99; P = .024). Although the optimal sequence is not established, postoperative RT is generally administered after adjuvant chemotherapy or concurrently for positive resection margins. Concurrent chemoradiation regimens recommended for all histologies for initial treatment include 1) cisplatin plus etoposide; and 2) carboplatin plus paclitaxel (see Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).

A few of the recommended concurrent chemoradiation regimens have an option for additional cycles (2 or 4) of chemotherapy after radiation, which is termed consolidation chemotherapy (see Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). If patients will be receiving durvalumab, the NCCN NSCLC Panel does not recommend consolidation chemotherapy based on concerns that adding consolidation chemotherapy will increase the risk of pneumonitis if patients are also receiving durvalumab. Durvalumab should be discontinued for patients with severe or life-threatening pneumonitis and should be withheld or discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information). If patients will not be receiving durvalumab because of medical contraindications or other reasons, consolidation chemotherapy is an option after concurrent chemoradiation, depending on the initial regimen. Systemic Therapy Chemotherapy Patients with metastatic (stage IV) NSCLC (who have a good PS) benefit from chemotherapy, usually with a platinum-based regimen, which was the only treatment option for many years before the advent of targeted therapy and immunotherapy regimens. If patients are not eligible for the targeted therapy or immunotherapy regimens, then chemotherapy regimens are recommended. Combination chemotherapy regimens produce 1-year survival rates of 30% to 40% and are more efficacious than single agents. However, survival rates are higher for patients with stage IV NSCLC who are eligible for either the newer targeted therapy or immunotherapy regimens. Phase 3 randomized trials have shown that many of the platinum-doublet combinations yield similar objective response rates and survival. The platinum-doublet regimens differ slightly for toxicity, convenience, and cost; thus, clinicians can individualize therapy for their patients. Non-platinum-based regimens are also options, such as 1) gemcitabine plus vinorelbine, or 2) gemcitabine plus docetaxel. The prognosis for stage IV inoperable lung cancer remains poor if patients are not candidates for targeted therapy or immunotherapy regimens. In the United States, frequently used initial cytotoxic regimens for stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC include: 1) cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus pemetrexed; or 2) carboplatin plus paclitaxel with (or without) bevacizumab. Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (or carboplatin) is often used for patients with stage IV squamous cell NSCLC. These chemotherapy regimens are recommended based on phase 3 randomized trials (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). A phase 3 randomized trial suggests that conventional cytotoxic agents should not be continued beyond 4 to 6 cycles of therapy; however, many patients assigned to a longer duration of therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles (see Maintenance Therapy in this Discussion). A phase 3 randomized trial assessed cisplatin plus pemetrexed versus cisplatin plus gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. For patients with adenocarcinoma who received cisplatin plus pemetrexed, median overall survival was 12.6 months compared with 10.9 months for those receiving cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71–0.99; P = .03). In contrast, for patients with squamous cell NSCLC who received cisplatin plus pemetrexed, overall survival was 9.4 versus 10.8 months for those receiving cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00–1.51; P = .05).

Many oncologists use pemetrexed-based regimens for stage IV adenocarcinomas (if patients are not candidates for targeted therapy or PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), because taxane-based regimens are associated with more toxicity (eg, neurotoxicity).790,810 There are no agents for the prevention of peripheral neuropathy, and few agents are useful for treatment.811 The POINTBREAK trial showed that carboplatin plus pemetrexed plus bevacizumab is a reasonable option for patients with metastatic NSCLC and confirmed that taxane-based regimens are more toxic than pemetrexed-based regimens.812 The POINTBREAK trial also showed that both regimens are similar in regard to overall survival rates; therefore, oncologists may return to using taxane-based regimens, which are well established. A retrospective cohort study suggests that the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel does not increase survival in patients ≥ 65 years with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.813 However, another retrospective cohort study reported increased survival in older patients.814 A combined analysis of the ECOG 4599 and POINTBREAK trials found a survival benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients < 75 years but no benefit in those > 75 years.815 Albumin-bound paclitaxel (also known as nab-paclitaxel) can be substituted for paclitaxel or docetaxel for patients: 1) who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions after receiving paclitaxel or docetaxel despite premedication; or 2) in whom premedications (ie, dexamethasone, H2 blockers, H1 blockers) to prevent hypersensitivity are contraindicated.816,817 A phase 3 randomized trial in patients with advanced NSCLC reported that an albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen is associated with less neurotoxicity and improved response rate, when compared with the control arm of paclitaxel plus carboplatin.818 Based on the trial and FDA approval, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends an albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen as initial cytotoxic therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC and good PS.

PD-L1 inhibitors are less beneficial in patients with some oncogenic drivers (ie, EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations, ALK rearrangements).184 Monitoring is recommended during initial therapy with response assessment with CT, with or without contrast, of known or high-risk sites of disease after 2 cycles and then every 2 to 4 cycles. During maintenance or subsequent therapy, monitoring is also recommended with CT, with or without contrast, every 6 to 12 weeks. ICIs (also known as immunotherapy or IO agents) are associated with a delay in benefit when compared with targeted therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends IHC testing for PD-L1 expression (category 1) before first-line treatment in all patients with metastatic NSCLC, regardless of histology, based on the efficacy of pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy.365 Ideally, PD-L1 expression levels are assessed before first-line therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC, if clinically feasible. Every effort also needs to be made to assess for oncogenic driver variants for which targeted therapies are available (eg, EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangements). Plasma-based ctDNA testing can be used to evaluate for genomic alterations if the assay has been validated and if the patient is unfit for invasive tissue sampling or if there is insufficient tissue for molecular analyses; however, plasma-based ctDNA testing is less sensitive than tissue assays. It is important to note that targeted therapies are recommended for patients with metastatic NSCLC and specific oncogenic drivers, independent of PD-L1 levels. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or more—but who also have a targetable driver oncogene molecular variant (eg, EGFR, ALK, ROS1)—should receive first-line targeted therapy for that oncogene and not first-line ICIs, because targeted therapies yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) than ICIs (lower response rates) in the first-line setting, targeted therapy is better tolerated, and these patients are less likely to respond to single-agent ICIs.184,371-373,827 For patients receiving first-line ICIs with or without chemotherapy, oncologists should be aware of the long half-life of the ICIs and potential adverse effects when using osimertinib in combination with or following ICIs.828,829 A few case reports suggest that patients treated with ICIs who have acquired resistance may have transformation to SCLC.830 In 2020, the NCCN Panel removed TMB as an emerging immune biomarker for patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data, concerns about variable TMB measurements, and other issues as previously described (see TMB in this Discussion).171,375,379 The NCCN Guidelines do not recommend measurement of TMB levels before deciding whether to use nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimens or other ICIs, such as pembrolizumab.171 The following content briefly summarizes the use of ICIs as first-line or subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC; detailed information, including clinical trial data, is provided in subsequent sections.831 ICIs may also be used in other settings; clinical trial data and appropriate use are described in greater detail elsewhere.

Chemotherapy regimens for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC included cisplatin (or carboplatin) plus pemetrexed and maintenance therapy with pemetrexed; patients with squamous cell NSCLC received cisplatin plus gemcitabine and best supportive care as maintenance therapy. Atezolizumab monotherapy was associated with fatal adverse reactions in 3.8% of all patients (11/286, all 3 groups), including aspiration, COPD, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, mechanical ileus, sepsis, cerebral infarction, and device occlusion; 4.2% of patients (11/263) receiving chemotherapy also died. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 12.9% of patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy versus 44.1% with chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions with atezolizumab monotherapy were pneumonia (2.8%), COPD (2.1%), and pneumonitis (2.1%); 28% of patients had serious adverse reactions. It is important to note that a different IHC assay was used to test for PD-L1 levels in IMpower110 (SP142 PD-L1 IHC assay) compared with IHC assays used for pembrolizumab monotherapy in KEYNOTE-024 (PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay); however, the results were similar regardless of which PD-L1 IHC assay was used.842,844 Data suggest that different methods of testing for PD-L1 levels are not equivalent.368,369 Based on an analysis using the SP142 PD-L1 IHC assay, median OS was 20.2 months (95% CI, 16.5–not estimable) with atezolizumab monotherapy (n = 107) versus 13.1 months (95% CI, 7.4–16.5 months) with chemotherapy (n = 98) (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.89; P= .0106) in patients with high PD-L1 expression.

First-Line Combination Therapy KEYNOTE-189, a phase 3 randomized trial, compared pembrolizumab added to carboplatin (or cisplatin) plus pemetrexed versus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.711 Most patients received pembrolizumab plus carboplatin plus pemetrexed (72% [445/616]) in this trial, but some received pembrolizumab plus cisplatin plus pemetrexed (28% [171/616]); patients did not have EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. The estimated rate of overall survival at one year was 69.2% (95% CI, 64.1%-73.8%) in patients receiving pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1%-56.2%) for chemotherapy alone (HR for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38-0.64; P < .001) after a median follow-up of 10.5 months. Overall survival was improved regardless of PD-L1 expression levels; TMB did not predict for response.970 For the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group, median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6-9.2) compared with 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7-5.5) for chemotherapy alone (HR for disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.64; P < .001). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred at a similar rate in both arms (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, 67.2% vs. chemotherapy, 65.8%). The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and either carboplatin or cisplatin (category 1; preferred) as a first-line therapy option for eligible patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC (ie, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma) or NSCLC NOS based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.711,712 The NCCN NSCLC Panel has preference stratified the systemic therapy regimens and decided that these pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy regimens are preferred first-line options for eligible patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.

A total of six treatment-related deaths occurred in patients receiving pembrolizumab (three at each dose) and five treatment-related deaths occurred in the docetaxel arm. Long-term data from KEYNOTE-010 show that 5-year survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC is approximately 15.6% for patients who received subsequent pembrolizumab monotherapy versus 6.5% for those receiving docetaxel. For patients with PD-L1 levels of 50% or more, 5-year overall survival was about 25% for patients receiving pembrolizumab versus 8.2% for those receiving docetaxel, respectively. If patients have not previously received a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent pembrolizumab (category 1; preferred) as a subsequent therapy option for patients with metastatic nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC and PD-L1 expression levels of 1% or more based on clinical trial data and FDA approval. Nivolumab and atezolizumab are also recommended subsequent therapy options in this setting (category 1; preferred). Testing for PD-L1 expression levels is recommended before prescribing pembrolizumab monotherapy (see Principles of Molecular and Biomarker Analysis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Tremelimumab-actl and Durvalumab Tremelimumab-actl is a monoclonal IgG2 antibody that enhances immune function by inhibiting CTLA-4 and preventing interactions with CD80/CD86; CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activation. Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 binding to PD-1 and CD80, thus increasing immune function (see Durvalumab in this Discussion). Immune-mediated adverse events may occur with ICIs, including tremelimumab-actl and durvalumab. For patients with immune-mediated adverse events, intravenous high-dose corticosteroids should be administered based on the severity of the reaction. Tremelimumab-actl and durvalumab should be permanently discontinued for patients with grades 2, 3, or 4 myocarditis and should be discontinued for other severe or life-threatening immune-mediated adverse events when indicated (see prescribing information). POSEIDON, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed three different first-line treatment arms in 1013 patients with metastatic NSCLC who did not have EGFR or ALK mutations. The treatment arms included 1) tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy; 2) durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy; and 3) platinum-based chemotherapy alone; there were 675 patients in arms 1 and 3. The chemotherapy regimens included 1) tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus albumin-bound paclitaxel plus carboplatin for either nonsquamous NSCLC or squamous cell histology; 2) tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin for nonsquamous NSCLC; or 3) tremelimumab plus durvalumab plus gemcitabine plus either cisplatin or carboplatin for squamous cell histology.

The category assignment (ie, category 1, 2A, or 2B) for the tremelimumab-actl plus durvalumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy regimens varies depending on the histology, chemotherapy, and PD-L1 levels. The NCCN Panel has preference stratified the tremelimumab-actl plus durvalumab plus chemotherapy regimens and decided that they are other recommended first-line therapy options for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical trial data.877 Maintenance Therapy Maintenance therapy refers to therapy given for patients with advanced NSCLC after 4 to 6 cycles of first-line therapy.879 Patients are only candidates for maintenance therapy if their tumors have responded to their previous treatment or they have stable disease and their tumors have not progressed. Continuation maintenance therapy refers to the use of at least one of the agents that was given in the first-line regimen. Switch maintenance therapy refers to the initiation of a different agent that was not included as part of the first-line regimen. Selection of appropriate maintenance therapy depends on several factors, such as histologic type, presence of mutations or gene fusions, and PS. Maintenance therapy is recommended in the NCCN Guidelines for select patients with tumor response or stable disease and is not recommended for all patients; it is not recommended for patients with PS 3 to 4 or those with progression (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).880 Monitoring is recommended during maintenance therapy with response assessment with CT, with or without contrast, of known or high-risk sites of disease every 6 to 12 weeks. Continuation Maintenance Therapy For continuation maintenance therapy, select agents (which were initially given with first-line therapy) may be continued until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity based on the design of the clinical trials that led to their approval. This section mainly discusses continuation maintenance with chemotherapy; continuation maintenance with ICIs is discussed in another section (see Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in this Discussion). Use of continuation maintenance therapy depends on several factors, such as whether the patient had minimal toxicity during treatment."}

A phase 3 randomized trial suggests that conventional cytotoxic agents should not be continued beyond 4 to 6 cycles of therapy; however, many patients assigned to a longer duration of therapy did not receive the planned number of cycles (see Maintenance Therapy in this Discussion).807,808 PARAMOUNT, a phase 3 randomized trial, reported that continuation maintenance therapy with pemetrexed slightly increased PFS when compared with placebo (4.1 vs. 2.8 months).881 Updated results from PARAMOUNT reported that continuation maintenance therapy with pemetrexed also improves overall survival (13.9 vs. 11.0 months).882 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends single-agent pemetrexed as continuation maintenance therapy (category 1) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC based on clinical trial data and FDA approval.881-883 POINTBREAK, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus pemetrexed compared with bevacizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients with metastatic NSCLC; patients received maintenance therapy with either bevacizumab plus pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone.812 PFS was 6 months with pemetrexed plus carboplatin plus bevacizumab versus 5.6 months with paclitaxel plus carboplatin plus bevacizumab.812 It is important to note that the pemetrexed-based arm was associated with less toxicity (eg, less neurotoxicity, less neutropenia, less hair loss) than the paclitaxel-based arm. AVAPERL, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus pemetrexed versus bevacizumab alone in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC; the initial regimen was bevacizumab plus cisplatin plus pemetrexed.884,885 An updated analysis reported that overall survival was 17.1 months with bevacizumab plus pemetrexed maintenance versus 13.2 months with bevacizumab alone (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.63–1.21; P = .29).884 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends continuation maintenance therapy with bevacizumab plus pemetrexed in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC who initially received bevacizumab plus pemetrexed plus platinum regimen based on clinical trial data.884,885 Single-agent bevacizumab (category 1) may be continued beyond 4 to 6 cycles of initial therapy (ie, platinum-doublet chemotherapy given with bevacizumab) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.806,883,886 The Panel recommends that bevacizumab biosimilars may be used in any of the systemic therapy regimens containing bevacizumab (eg, carboplatin plus paclitaxel plus bevacizumab) that are used for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC based on clinical data and FDA approvals.833,846-849 Therefore, if a bevacizumab biosimilar was initially used as part of first-line combination therapy, the biosimilar should be continued as maintenance therapy in eligible patients.

The cutoff thresholds are 6 mm for a positive scan result for incidental solid and subsolid lung nodules detected on chest CT based on the Fleischner criteria (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).91-95 As previously described, low-dose CT screening is recommended for asymptomatic select patients who are at high risk for lung cancer and management of any nodules detected in these patients is described elsewhere (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org). After patients are confirmed to have NSCLC based on a pathologic diagnosis, a clinical evaluation needs to be done (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with symptoms, the clinical stage is initially determined from disease history (ie, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss) and physical examination together with a limited battery of tests (see Initial Evaluation and Clinical Stage in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). The NCCN NSCLC Panel also recommends that smoking cessation advice, counseling, and pharmacotherapy be provided to patients.49,899-901 After the clinical stage is determined, the patient is assigned to one of the pathways that are defined by the stage, specific subdivision of the particular stage, and location of the tumor. Note that for some patients, diagnosis, staging, and surgical resection are done during the same operative procedure. A multidisciplinary evaluation should be done before treatment. Additional Pretreatment Evaluation As previously noted, evaluation of the mediastinal nodes is a key step in further staging of the patient. FDG PET/CT scans can be used as an initial assessment of the hilar and mediastinal nodes (ie, to determine whether the N1, N2, or N3 nodes are positive for cancer, which is a key determinant of stage II and stage III disease); however, CT scans have known limitations for evaluating the extent of lymph node involvement in lung cancer.109,902-904 When compared with noninvasive staging methods (EBUS, EUS), surgical staging with mediastinoscopy is more appropriate for certain settings when evaluating mediastinal nodes; however, clinicians use both methods when staging patients.109 Thus, mediastinoscopy is encouraged as part of the initial evaluation, particularly if the results of imaging are not conclusive and the probability of mediastinal involvement is high (based on tumor size and location). Therefore, mediastinoscopy is appropriate for patients with T2 to T3 lesions even if the FDG PET/CT scan does not suggest mediastinal node involvement. Mediastinoscopy may also be appropriate to confirm mediastinal node involvement in patients with a positive FDG PET/CT scan. Although mediastinal biopsy is generally preferred, the risks in selected patients may outweigh the benefits, such as patients who are medically inoperable. In patients with peripheral tumors (outer one third of the lung) less than 3 cm, pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation is optional if the nodes are FDG PET/CT negative because there is a low likelihood of positive mediastinal nodes.905 Invasive mediastinal staging is recommended for central tumors. Mediastinal evaluation can be considered in patients with clinical stage IA disease (T1abc,N0). In patients with peripheral T2a, central T1abc, or T2a lesions with negative FDG PET/CT scans, the risk for mediastinal lymph node involvement is higher and mediastinoscopy and/or EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA are recommended. Dilemans et al have reported a selective mediastinoscopy strategy, proceeding straight to thoracotomy without mediastinoscopy for T1 peripheral tumors without enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes on preoperative CT.906 This strategy"}

For identifying N2 disease, chest CT scans had sensitivity and specificity rates of 69% and 71%, respectively. Using a chest CT scan plus mediastinoscopy was significantly more accurate (89% vs. 71%) than using a chest CT scan alone for identifying N2 disease. When using CT scans, node positivity is based on the size of the lymph nodes. Therefore, a CT scan will miss small metastases that do not result in node enlargement. To address this issue, Arita et al specifically examined lung cancer metastases in normal size mediastinal lymph nodes in 90 patients and found an incidence of 16% (14/90) false-negative chest CT scans with histologic identification of occult N2 or N3 disease. Bronchoscopy is used in diagnosis and local staging of both central and peripheral lung lesions and is recommended for pretreatment evaluation of stage I to IIIA tumors. In patients who present with a solitary pulmonary nodule where the suspicion of malignancy is high, surgical resection without prior invasive testing may be reasonable. As previously mentioned, CT scans have known limitations for evaluating the extent of lymph node involvement in lung cancer. PET scans have been used to help evaluate the extent of disease and to provide more accurate staging. The NCCN NSCLC Panel reviewed the diagnostic performance of CT and PET scans. The panel assessed studies that examined the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT scans for mediastinal lymph node staging. Depending on the clinical scenario, a sensitivity of 40% to 65% and a specificity of 45% to 90% were reported. Because they detect tumor physiology, as opposed to anatomy, PET scans may be more sensitive than CT scans. Moreover, if postobstructive pneumonitis is present, there is little correlation between the size of the mediastinal lymph nodes and tumor involvement. Chin et al found that PET, when used to stage the mediastinal nodes, was 78% sensitive and 81% specific with a negative predictive value of 89%. Kernstine et al compared PET scan to CT scan for identifying N2 and N3 disease in NSCLC. The PET scan was found to be more sensitive than the CT scan in identifying mediastinal node disease (70% vs. 65%). FDG PET/CT has been shown to be useful in restaging patients after adjuvant therapy. When patients with early-stage disease are accurately staged using FDG PET/CT, inappropriate surgery is avoided. The NCCN NSCLC Panel believes that PET scans can play a role in the evaluation and more accurate staging of NSCLC, for example, in identifying stage I (peripheral and central T1-2,N0), stage II, stage III, and stage IV diseases. However, FDG PET/CT is even more sensitive and is recommended by the panel. PET/CT is typically done from the skull base to the knees; whole body PET/CT may also be done. Positive FDG PET/CT scan findings for distant disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation (eg, MRI of bone). If the FDG PET/CT scan is positive in the mediastinum, the lymph node status needs pathologic confirmation. Transesophageal EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA have proven useful to stage patients or to diagnose mediastinal lesions; these techniques can be used instead of invasive staging procedures in select patients. When compared with CT and PET, EBUS-TBNA has a high sensitivity and specificity for staging mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer. In patients with positive nodes on CT or PET, EBUS-TNBA can be used to clarify the results. In patients with negative findings on EBUS-TNBA, conventional mediastinoscopy can be done to confirm the results. Note that EBUS is also known as endosonography. The routine use of bone scans (to exclude bone metastases) is not recommended. Brain MRI with contrast is recommended to rule out asymptomatic brain metastases in patients with stage II, III, and IV disease if aggressive combined-modality therapy is being considered."}

If brain MRI cannot be done, then CT of the head with contrast is an option. Note that PET scans are not recommended for assessing whether brain metastases are present (see the NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers, available at www.NCCN.org). Initial Therapy As previously mentioned, accurate pathologic assessment and staging are essential before treatment for NSCLC, because management varies depending on the stage, histology, presence of genetic variants, and PS. Before treatment, it is strongly recommended that determination of tumor resectability be made by thoracic surgeons who perform lung cancer surgery as a prominent part of their practice (see Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). RT doses are provided in the algorithm (see Principles of Radiation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In addition, the NCCN Guidelines also recommend regimens for targeted therapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and chemoradiation (see Perioperative Systemic Therapy, Concurrent Chemoradiation Regimens, Molecular and Biomarker-Directed Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease, and Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). First-line targeted therapy options are recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and positive test results for actionable driver mutations such as ALK, BRAF p.V600E, EGFR, METex14 skipping, NTRK1/2/3, RET, and ROS1. Second-line targeted therapy options are recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and positive test results for EGFR exon 20 insertions or KRAS p.G12C mutations. First-line immunotherapy options are recommended for eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC and negative test results for actionable driver mutations. Immunotherapy options may be used as first-line or subsequent therapy options in eligible patients with actionable driver mutations as shown in the algorithm, although they are generally not preferred options. Stage I, Stage II, and Stage IIIA Disease Depending on the extent and type of comorbidity present, patients with stage I or a subset of stage II (T1–2,N1) tumors are generally candidates for surgical resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Definitive RT, preferably SABR, is recommended for patients with early-stage NSCLC who are medically inoperable or refuse surgery; RT can be considered as an alternative to surgery in patients at high risk of complications (see Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in this Discussion and see Initial Treatment for Stage I and II in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Image-guided thermal ablation (eg, cryotherapy, microwave, RFA) is an option for selected patients who are medically inoperable and not receiving SABR or definitive RT (see Principles of Image-Guided Thermal Ablation Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In some instances, positive mediastinal nodes (N2) are discovered at surgery; in this setting, an additional assessment of staging and tumor resectability must be made, and the treatment (ie, inclusion of systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection) must be modified accordingly. Therefore, the NCCN Guidelines include two different tracks for T1–2,N2 disease (ie, stage IIIA disease): 1) T1–2,N2 disease discovered unexpectedly at surgical exploration; and 2) T1–2,N2 disease confirmed before thoracotomy. In the second case, an initial brain MRI with contrast and FDG PET/CT scan (if not previously done) are recommended to rule out metastatic disease. For patients with clinical stage IIB (T3,N0) and stage IIIA tumors who have different treatment options (surgery, RT, or chemotherapy), a multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended before treatment.

Patients with possibly resectable superior sulcus tumors should undergo preoperative concurrent chemoradiation before surgical re-evaluation (including CT with or without contrast ± PET/CT). For patients with unresectable tumors (T4 extension,N0–1) in the superior sulcus, definitive concurrent chemoradiation is recommended followed by durvalumab (category 1). 781,935 Definitive concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for patients with medically inoperable stage II or III NSCLC. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends durvalumab (category 1) as a consolidation immunotherapy option for eligible patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and without disease progression after treatment with definitive concurrent chemoradiation based on clinical trial data and FDA approval (see Chemoradiation in this Discussion and the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). 16,363,786 The panel also recommends durvalumab as a consolidation immunotherapy option (regardless of PD-L1 status) for eligible patients (PS 0–1) with unresectable stage II NSCLC but without disease progression after definitive concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation. The recommendation for consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab occurs in multiple places in the NCCN Guidelines. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment option for patients with tumors of the chest wall, proximal airway, or mediastinum (T3–4,N0–1). Other treatment options include preoperative systemic therapy or concurrent chemoradiation before surgical resection. For unresectable tumors (T4,N0–1) without pleural effusion, definitive concurrent chemoradiation (category 1) is recommended followed by consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab (category 1). 16,447,702,786 Additional chemotherapy (ie, consolidation chemotherapy) is an option if patients will not be receiving durvalumab. 532,778 However, consolidation chemotherapy is not recommended if patients will be receiving durvalumab, based on concerns that consolidation chemotherapy will increase the risk of pneumonitis if patients are also receiving durvalumab. Multimodality therapy is recommended for most patients with stage III NSCLC. 774 For patients with stage IIIA disease and positive mediastinal nodes (T1–2,N2), treatment is based on the findings of pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).

When a lung metastasis is present, it usually occurs in a patient with other systemic metastases; the prognosis is poor. Therefore, many of these patients are not candidates for surgery; however, systemic therapy is recommended. Although uncommon, patients with lung metastases but without systemic metastases have a better prognosis and are candidates for surgery (see Multiple Lung Cancers in this Discussion).936 Patients with separate pulmonary nodule(s) in the same lobe (T3,N0–1) or ipsilateral non-primary lobe (T4,N0–1), without other systemic metastases, are potentially curable by surgery; 5-year survival rates are about 30%.937 For those with N2 nodes after surgery, concurrent chemoradiation is recommended for those with positive margins and an R2 resection; either sequential or concurrent chemoradiation is recommended after an R1 resection. Most NCCN Member Institutions favor concurrent chemoradiation for positive margins, but sequential chemoradiation is reasonable in frailer patients.768 For those with N2 nodes and negative margins, I chemotherapy (category 1) or sequential chemotherapy with RT is recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or osimertinib is recommended for those with N0–1, depending on EGFR mutation levels and PD-L1 levels (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). In patients with synchronous solitary nodules (contralateral lung), the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends treating them as two primary lung tumors if both are curable, even if the histology of the two tumors is similar.938\nMultiple Lung Cancers\nPatients with a history of lung cancer or those with biopsy-proven synchronous lesions may be suspected of or confirmed with having multiple lung cancers.939,940 It is important to determine whether the multiple lung cancers are metastases or separate lung primaries (synchronous or metachronous); most multiple lung tumors are metastases.86,394,941,942 Lesions with different cell types, such as squamous cell or adenocarcinoma, are usually different primary tumors. However, lesions of the same cell type may not be metastases. Therefore, it is essential to determine the histology of the lung tumor (see Principles of Pathologic Review in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Infection and other benign diseases also need to be ruled out (eg, inflammatory granulomas).943,944 Although criteria have been established for diagnosing multiple lung cancers, no definitive method has been established before treatment.944-947 The Martini and Melamed criteria are often used to diagnose multiple lung cancers as follows: 1) the histologies are different; or 2) the histologies are the same, but there is no lymph node involvement and no extrathoracic metastases.947 Data suggest that NGS testing may help determine whether separate lung nodules are clonally related.948-950 Broad molecular profiling can be used to assess multiple lung lesions (see Summary of the Guidelines Updates in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). For example, tumors with non-overlapping, unique mutations are considered to be clonally unrelated, separate primary lung cancers even if they are histologically similar. Therefore, these tumors can be treated with local therapy (see Multiple Lung Cancers in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Treatment of multiple lung cancers depends on the status of the lymph nodes (eg, N0–1) and on whether patients are asymptomatic, symptomatic, or at high or low risk of becoming symptomatic.941,951-953 Patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting by thoracic surgeons, pulmonary medicine, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists. In patients eligible for definitive local therapy, parenchymal-sparing resection is preferred (see the Principles of Surgical Therapy in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).940,941 VATS or SABR are reasonable options depending on the number and distribution of the tumors requiring local treatment.954 Multiple lung nodules (eg, solid, subsolid nodules) may also be detected on CT scans; some of these"}

If patients will not be receiving durvalumab because of medical contraindications or other reasons, consolidation chemotherapy is an option after concurrent chemoradiation.532,778 For metastatic disease that is confirmed by FDG PET/CT scan and brain MRI with contrast, treatment is described in the NCCN Guidelines for limited or metastatic disease. For the 2023 update (Version 1), the NCCN NSCLC Panel revised the algorithm for multiple lung cancers. For example, the NCCN Panel added an initial recommendation for multidisciplinary evaluation for patients suspected of or confirmed with having multiple lung cancers. One of the goals during multidisciplinary evaluation for multiple lung cancers is to assess whether patients have lung nodules that can be observed instead of erroneously assuming that patients have stage IV NSCLC. The panel added the following caveats: lesions at low risk of becoming symptomatic can be observed, such as small subsolid nodules with slow growth. However, treatment should be considered if the lesion(s) show accelerating growth, increasing solid component, or increasing FDG uptake, even if the lesions are small. Stage IIIB and IIIC NSCLC Stage IIIB NSCLC comprises two unresectable groups, including: 1) T1–2,N3 tumors; and 2) T3–4,N2 tumors; stage IIIC NSCLC includes T3,N3 and contralateral mediastinal nodes (T4,N3), which are also unresectable. Surgical resection is not recommended in patients with T1–2,N3 disease. However, in patients with suspected N3 disease, the NCCN Guidelines recommend pathologic confirmation of nodal status (see Pretreatment Evaluation in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).956,957 In addition, FDG PET/CT scans (if not previously done) and brain MRI with contrast should also be included in the pretreatment evaluation. If these imaging tests are negative, then treatment options for the appropriate nodal status should be followed (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).

This section focuses on patients with limited metastatic disease; management of widespread distant metastases is described in another section (see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Biomarker testing is recommended for patients with stage IVA disease (see Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers in this Discussion). Pleural or pericardial effusion is a criterion for stage IV, M1a disease. T4 with pleural effusion is classified as stage IV, M1a (see Table 3 in Staging in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).158 Pleural or pericardial effusions are malignant in 90% to 95% of patients; however, they may be related to obstructive pneumonitis, atelectasis, lymphatic or venous obstruction, or a pulmonary embolus. Therefore, pathologic confirmation of a malignant effusion by using thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis is recommended. In certain cases where thoracentesis is inconclusive, thoracoscopy may be performed. In the absence of nonmalignant causes (eg, obstructive pneumonia), an exudate or sanguineous effusion is considered malignant regardless of the results of cytologic examination. If the pleural or pericardial effusion is considered negative for malignancy (M0), recommended treatment is based on the confirmed T and N stage (see the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Data suggest that most pleural or pericardial effusions are associated with unresectable disease in 95% of cases.963 In patients with effusions that are positive for malignancy, the tumor is defined as M1a and is treated with local therapy (ie, ambulatory small catheter drainage, pleurodesis, and pericardial window) in addition to treatment as for stage IV disease.964,965 Care of patients with distant metastases in limited sites (ie, stage IVA,M1b) and good PS depends on the location and number of the metastases; the diagnosis is aided by mediastinoscopy, bronchoscopy, FDG PET/CT scan, and brain MRI with contrast. The increased sensitivity of FDG PET/CT scans, compared with other imaging methods, may identify additional metastases and, thus, spare some patients from unnecessary futile surgery. Positive FDG PET/CT scan findings for distant disease need pathologic or other radiologic confirmation. If the FDG PET/CT scan is positive in the mediastinum, the lymph node status needs pathologic confirmation. Patients with oligometastatic disease (eg, brain metastases) and otherwise limited disease in the chest may benefit from aggressive local therapy to both the primary chest and metastatic sites.584,966 Aggressive local therapy may comprise surgery and/or definitive RT, including SRS and SABR, and may be preceded or followed by chemotherapy. After progression on TKIs, patients with EGFR mutation–positive metastatic NSCLC may be able to continue with their current TKIs; local therapy can be considered to treat their limited progression (eg, SRS to brain metastases or other sites, SABR for limited thoracic or other metastatic disease; surgery).967,968 Neoadjuvant or Adjuvant Therapy Chemotherapy, Chemoradiation, Immunotherapy, and Targeted Therapy On the basis of clinical studies,690-692 the NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends cisplatin combined with docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy options (also known as perioperative therapy) for all histologies in eligible patients with locally advanced disease.

Data from randomized phase 3 trials are not available to clarify surveillance recommendations; therefore, the most appropriate schedules are controversial.983-988 The surveillance recommendations were compiled by polling the NCCN NSCLC Panel regarding their practice patterns. Details regarding the specific surveillance schedules are outlined in the algorithm based on stage and the definitive treatment (see Surveillance After Completion of Definitive Therapy in the algorithm). Surveillance schedules for most patients with metastatic disease are individualized for each patient, although the NCCN Guidelines provide a surveillance schedule for certain patients with stage IV oligometastatic disease. NLST, a large randomized trial, assessed lung screening with low-dose CT screening versus chest radiography in individuals at high risk for lung cancer.73 Low-dose CT screening decreased mortality from lung cancer (mainly adenocarcinoma) compared with chest radiography (247 vs. 309 deaths, respectively; 20% relative reduction in mortality; 95% CI, 6.8–26.7; P = .004).73 Low-dose CT is recommended for screening individuals at high risk for lung cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening, available at www.NCCN.org). The NCCN NSCLC Panel feels that low-dose CT is beneficial for identifying recurrences in patients previously treated for NSCLC. It is important to note that the surveillance recommendations for patients who have been treated for NSCLC are different from the screening recommendations for individuals at high risk for lung cancer (see the NCCN Guidelines for Lung Cancer Screening). The NCCN Guidelines recommend a chest CT scan with (or without) contrast and an H&P for the initial surveillance schedules (2–5 years after definitive treatment) followed by annual low-dose non-contrast–enhanced CT and an H&P (see Surveillance After Completion of Definitive Therapy in the algorithm).986,987,989-992 Patients treated with chemotherapy with (or without) RT who have residual abnormalities may require more frequent imaging. FDG PET/CT or brain MRI is not routinely recommended for routine surveillance in patients without symptoms.983 But, PET may be useful for assessing CT scans that appear to show malignant neoplasms but may be radiation fibrosis, atelectasis, or other benign conditions. Areas previously treated with RT may remain FDG avid for up to 2 years; therefore, histologic confirmation of suspicious areas with apparent “recurrent” disease is needed.993 The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends assessing patients with recurrences using PET/CT and brain MRI with contrast; if brain MRI is not possible, then CT with contrast of the head is recommended. Information about smoking cessation (eg, advice, counseling, therapy) should be provided for patients undergoing surveillance to improve their quality of life. The NCCN Guidelines include information about the long-term follow-up care of NSCLC survivors (see Cancer Survivorship Care in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). These recommendations include guidelines for routine cancer surveillance, immunizations, health monitoring, counseling for wellness and health promotion, and cancer screening (see the NCCN Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening, NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis, and NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer Early Detection, available at www.NCCN.org). An analysis suggests that patients who survive lung cancer have a high symptom burden 1 year after diagnosis and therefore need management after treatment.994 Treatment of Recurrences and Distant Metastases Recurrences are subdivided into locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. Management of locoregional recurrences or symptomatic local disease—endobronchial obstruction, mediastinal lymph node recurrence, superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, and severe hemoptysis—is described in the NCCN Guidelines (see Therapy for Recurrence and Metastasis in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).664 An Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

Similarly, patients with limited-site oligometastatic disease and good PS may benefit from aggressive local therapies to the metastatic and primary sites, with clinical data suggesting the possibility of long-term survival (see Initial Treatment for Stage IVA, M1b in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC).607,608,611,654,997-1000 In addition, emerging clinical data suggest the feasibility of definitive reirradiation of local recurrences within prior RT fields using highly conformal techniques, although this should be limited to highly selected cases in specialty centers with appropriate expertise because of the potential for severe toxicity with high cumulative radiation doses to critical structures.477,631-633,1001-1004 In patients with NSCLC who have bone metastases, data suggest that denosumab increases median overall survival when compared with zoledronic acid (9.5 vs. 8 months).1005 The FDA has approved the use of zoledronic acid and denosumab in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.1006,1007 Denosumab and bisphosphonate therapy can be associated with severe hypocalcemia; patients with hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency are at increased risk for hypocalcemia. Denosumab or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy can be considered in patients with bone metastases to decrease bone complications (eg, decrease pain, delay skeletal-related events) based on clinical trial data.182,1005,1008-1011 Version 5.2025 © 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®), All rights reserved.

Smoking cessation counseling (if necessary) and palliative care should also be integrated into the disease management strategy. Data suggest that early palliative care is associated with higher quality of life in patients with metastatic NSCLC.720 Molecular testing for somatic, disease-associated oncogenic driver mutations or alterations should be conducted as part of broad molecular profiling, which is strongly recommended by the panel. Broad molecular profiling is defined as molecular testing that identifies all actionable molecular biomarkers specified in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC in either a single assay or a combination of a limited number of assays, and optimally also identifies emerging biomarkers. Tiered approaches based on low prevalence of co-occurring biomarkers are acceptable. The goal of broad molecular profiling is to identify driver alterations that can guide use of available targeted therapies or to appropriately counsel patients regarding potential clinical trials that may be available. Therefore, broad molecular profiling is considered a key component of improving care for patients with NSCLC. Molecular testing via biopsy and/or plasma testing is recommended; combinations of tissue and plasma testing, either concurrently or in sequence, are acceptable. Evidence suggests that concurrent testing can improve time to test results and should be considered depending on the clinical situation.197,1012-1017 Negative results (defined as the absence of a definitive driver mutation) by one method suggest that a complementary method may be used. Molecular testing for EGFR, ALK, KRAS, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK1/2/3, METex14 skipping, RET, and ERBB2 (HER2) alterations is recommended in all patients with advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC (ie, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma) and NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS); EGFR mutation and ALK rearrangement testing are category 1 recommendations for patients with nonsquamous NSCLC or NSCLC NOS based on the data available to recommend targeted therapies for these biomarkers. As the cumulative incidence of targetable molecular alterations in squamous cell carcinoma across all alterations ranges from 2% to 10%,136,137,184,185 the same molecular testing should be considered in all patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma, and not just those with certain clinical characteristics, such as never smoking status and mixed histology. If a clinically actionable biomarker is found, the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC provide appropriate therapy recommendations. If results are unknown or pending, patients can be treated as if they do not have driver oncogenes. However, retrospective data indicate that the availability of molecular testing prior to treatment initiation is associated with longer overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.10,18 If patients require an urgent start to therapy, clinicians should consider holding immunotherapy for one cycle (ie, just use platinum-based chemotherapy regimens). Clinicians need to be aware of the long half-life of immune checkpoint inhibitors and the potential for higher rates of side effects when using certain targeted therapies, (such as osimertinib) in combination with or following checkpoint inhibitors.828,829,1019,1020 If a clinical actionable biomarker is discovered during first-line systemic therapy, then the planned systemic therapy (including maintenance therapy) can be either interrupted or completed before switching to the appropriate targeted therapy.

{"page_number": 195, "title": "page_195", "chinese_summary": "该页面详细介绍了非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）的NCCN指南，特别关注于晚期或转移性NSCLC的治疗策略。首先，推荐在一线治疗前进行程序性死亡配体1（PD-L1）表达测试，以评估免疫检查点抑制剂（ICIs）的使用可能性，尤其是在没有可操作分子生物标志物的情况下。治疗选择根据PD-L1水平进行分层，包括免疫疗法（有或无化疗）。对于具有某些致癌驱动基因的晚期或转移性NSCLC患者，一线治疗推荐靶向疗法而非ICIs，因为靶向疗法通常具有更高的反应率且耐受性更好。例如，EGFR突变患者对靶向疗法反应良好，而KRAS G12C突变患者则可能从免疫疗法中受益。监测方面，建议在初始治疗期间每2至4个周期进行CT扫描（有或无对比剂）以评估已知或高风险病灶的反应。EGFR改变在NSCLC患者中常见，主要包括19号外显子缺失和21号外显子L858R点突变，这些改变与小分子EGFR酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（TKIs）的敏感性相关。此外，还讨论了其他较少见的EGFR突变及其对不同代EGFR TKIs的敏感性。EGFR T790M突变与EGFR TKI治疗获得性耐药相关，若在未接受过EGFR TKI治疗的患者中检测到T790M突变，应考虑遗传咨询和可能的种系遗传测试，因为种系EGFR T790M突变无论吸烟状态如何，都会增加肺癌风险。", "original_text": "this decision include the level of toxicity that the patient is experiencing and whether a clinical or radiographic response has been observed. Upfront programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression testing before first-line therapy is also a category 1 recommendation (regardless of histology) in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC to assess how immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) could be used if no actionable molecular biomarkers are identified. Treatment options for advanced or metastatic NSCLC without actionable molecular biomarkers are stratified by PD-L1 level and include systemic therapy options such as immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy (see NSCL-37 and NSCL-38 in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC). Refer to the full Guidelines at www.NCCN.org for complete treatment recommendations for advanced or metastatic NSCLC based on PD-L1 levels in the absence of a clinically actionable marker. In the NCCN Guidelines, targeted therapies with a first-line indication are recommended as initial therapy (rather than first-line ICIs) for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC and some (but not all) oncogenic drivers, regardless of PD-L1 levels. The rationale is that targeted therapies typically yield higher response rates (eg, osimertinib, 80%) than ICIs (poor response rates) in the first-line setting, and targeted therapy is better tolerated. It should be noted that targeted therapies are not available or recommended for NSCLC with certain actionable biomarkers in the first-line setting. For instance, patients with NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutations are likely to benefit from immunotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) in the first-line setting. Targeted therapies are recommended only in the second-line setting or later for those with KRAS G12C mutations. Monitoring is recommended during initial therapy with response assessment with CT (with or without contrast) of known or high-risk sites of disease (such as chest, abdomen, and pelvis) after 2 cycles and then every 2 to 4 cycles. Likewise, monitoring of known or high-risk sites of disease is also recommended during maintenance or subsequent therapy with CT (with or without contrast) every 6 to 12 weeks. For complete treatment recommendations for advanced or metastatic NSCLC, see NSCL-19. NSCLC with EGFR Alterations Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is altered in a subset of patients with NSCLC. The two most common EGFR alterations in NSCLC are deletions in exon 19 (with conserved deletion of the LREA sequence) and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R); these represent approximately 85% to 90% of all EGFR alterations in NSCLC. Both result in activation of the tyrosine kinase domain and are associated with sensitivity to small-molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These EGFR alterations are found in approximately 10% of white patients with NSCLC and up to 19% of Black and 50% of Asian patients. Other less common EGFR mutations (approximately 10%) include exon 20 S768I, exon 21 L861Q, and/or exon 18 G719X. These mutations have varying degrees of sensitivity to first- (erlotinib/gefitinib), second- (afatinib/dacomitinib), and third- (osimertinib) generation EGFR TKIs. EGFR T790M is an EGFR exon 20 mutation associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy and has been reported in about 60% of patients with disease progression after initial response to afatinib, erlotinib, or gefitinib. If EGFR T790M is identified in the absence of prior EGFR TKI therapy, genetic counseling and possible germline genetic testing are warranted. Identification of germline EGFR T790M confers a high risk for lung cancer regardless of smoking status."}

Single-agent erlotinib, afatinib, gefitinib, or dacomitinib are other recommended first-line treatment options. All of these are category 1 recommendations and are appropriate for patients with performance status 0-4. The following combination regimens are also included in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC as \"other recommended\" options for advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutations in the first-line setting: osimertinib in combination with pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin (category 1; nonsquamous), erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab (nonsquamous and no recent history of hemoptysis), or erlotinib in combination with ramucirumab. An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab. Targeted therapies are also recommended as an option if an EGFR exon 19 deletion or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation is discovered during first-line systemic therapy. For patients receiving first-line ICIs with or without chemotherapy, oncologists should be aware of the long half-life of the ICI and potential AEs when using osimertinib (or other TKIs) in combination with or following ICIs.828,829,1019,1020 For example, the rate of AEs, such as pneumonitis, is higher when osimertinib is initiated within 3 months of treatment with certain ICIs.828 In patients who experience disease progression after receiving first-line osimertinib, decisions about subsequent therapies are guided by disease symptoms as well as sites of progression. Changes in systemic therapy are generally recommended if patients have symptomatic systemic progression and/or multiple lesions. When considering second-line systemic therapy, ideally patients should be re-biopsied to rule out transformation to small cell histology, a phenomenon that occurs in approximately 5% EGFR TKI-resistant tumors.265,278 Amivantamab-vjxw in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed is a category 1 and preferred treatment option for patients with multiple lesions (if nonsquamous).

Clinical Data: NSCLC with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutation For patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 20 insertions, treatment with early-generation EGFR TKIs has generally not been associated with disease response.178,179,257 Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion-positive metastatic NSCLC have frequently been treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.297,299 The response rates (0%-25%) to immunotherapy regimens vary, depending on the specific EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation.179,302 Mobocertinib, an EGFR TKI developed specifically for patients with EGFR exon 20 insertions, was previously granted accelerated approval by the FDA in the United States. However, mobocertinib was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2023 and is no longer recommended as a subsequent treatment option by the panel based on data from the phase 3 EXCLAIM-2 trial, which compared first-line mobocertinib to platinum-based chemotherapy, as the primary endpoint was not met.1048,1049 Single-agent amivantamab-vmjw is FDA-approved for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.1050 CHRYSALIS, a phase 1 study, assessed subsequent therapy with amivantamab-vmjw in 81 patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion-positive metastatic NSCLC who had received one or more previous lines of therapy.178 The overall response rate was 40%, with 3 complete responses. The median PFS was 8.3 months. Common treatment-related AEs included cutaneous reactions, infusion-related reactions, and paronychia. The most common grade 3 to 4 AEs included hypokalemia as well as pulmonary embolism, neutropenia, diarrhea, and rash. Eight deaths were reported in the safety assessment (7%). Amivantamab-vmjw in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed is also approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.1050 PAPILLON, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed the efficacy and safety of first-line amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy (pemetrexed and carboplatin) versus chemotherapy alone in 308 patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions who had not previously received systemic therapy.1051 The median PFS was longer in the amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy group than in the chemotherapy alone group (11.4 months vs. 6.7 months; HR, 0.40; P < .001). Based on the interim OS analysis, the HR for amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone was 0.67 (P = .11). The most common AEs reported with amivantamab-vmjw plus chemotherapy were hematologic effects and skin-related EGFR-related toxic events (eg, rash, paronychia, dermatitis acneiform).

See NSCL-37 and NSCL-38 in the full NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC at www.NCCN.org for treatment recommendations based on PD-L1 level.\nThe panel recommends sotorasib or adagrasib as subsequent therapy options for patients who experience disease progression after treatment with first-line systemic therapy. Sotorasib or adagrasib may also be used as third-line therapy or beyond if the patient has not previously received a KRAS G12C-targeted therapy. The panel notes that switching between agents with a similar mechanism of action at the time of progression is not recommended.\nNSCLC with ALK Rearrangement\nAbout 5% of patients with NSCLC have ALK gene rearrangements leading to gene fusions.120 These events can result in dysregulation and inappropriate ALK signaling.1058\nClinical Data\nInitial studies have shown that single-agent ALK inhibitors (crizotinib and ceritinib) are superior to chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with ALK rearrangements.218-220,1059 Both crizotinib and ceritinib are FDA-approved for the treatment of adults with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.1060,1061 Subsequent trials have compared newer agents to crizotinib.\nAlectinib is an ALK inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.1062,1063 ALEX, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed first-line therapy with alectinib versus crizotinib in 303 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC including those with asymptomatic CNS disease.218 Disease progression or death occurred in a lower proportion of patients receiving alectinib when compared with crizotinib (41% vs. 68%).

At the first interim analysis, PFS rate was higher in patients receiving brigatinib (67%) than in those receiving crizotinib (43%) (HR, 0.49; P < .001). The rate of intracranial response was also higher with brigatinib (78%) versus crizotinib (29%). At the second interim analysis (24.9 months of median follow-up), brigatinib continued to show improved blinded independent review committee (BIRC)-assessed PFS when compared with crizotinib (48% vs. 26%; HR, 0.49; P <.0001). After 3 years, the PFS was 43% for brigatinib versus 19% for crizotinib (HR, 0.48). The median OS was not reached in either arm; however, a post-hoc analysis suggested a survival benefit for patients with intracranial metastasis (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.89). Lorlatinib is an ALK inhibitor that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. CROWN, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed lorlatinib versus crizotinib as first-line therapy in 296 patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. At 12 months, 78% of patients were alive without disease progression in the lorlatinib group versus 39% in the crizotinib group (HR, 0.28; P <.001). The objective response rate was 76% for patients receiving lorlatinib and 58% for those receiving crizotinib. For patients with measurable brain metastases, an intracranial response was reported in 82% of those receiving lorlatinib and 23% of those receiving crizotinib. A complete intracranial response was achieved in 71% of those who received lorlatinib. Hyperlipidemia, edema, increased weight, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive effects were the most common AEs seen with lorlatinib. More grade 3 or 4 AEs (mainly altered lipid levels) occurred with lorlatinib than with crizotinib (72% vs. 56%, respectively). A post hoc analysis of the CROWN study showed that in patients with brain metastases at baseline, the 12-month cumulative incidence of CNS progression was 7% with lorlatinib compared with 72% with crizotinib; the 12-month PFS rates were 78% versus 22%, respectively. In patients without brain metastases at baseline, the 12-month cumulative incidence of CNS progression was 1% with lorlatinib compared with 18% with crizotinib; the 12-month PFS rates were 78% versus 45%, respectively. Updated data from the CROWN trial demonstrated that the 3-year PFS rate was 64% with lorlatinib and 19% with crizotinib. Additionally, the HR for time to intracranial progression for lorlatinib in comparison to crizotinib was 0.10 among those with baseline brain metastases and 0.02 among those without brain metastases at baseline. Data have suggested that lorlatinib can be used as subsequent therapy in patients with disease progression after treatment with other ALK inhibitors, including those with CNS metastases. A phase 2 trial assessed lorlatinib in patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC and disease progression after ALK inhibitor therapy; many patients had asymptomatic CNS metastases. In the cohort of ALK-positive patients who had received at least one previous ALK inhibitor, objective responses were achieved in 47% of patients; there were 4 complete responses and 89 partial responses. In those with measurable baseline CNS lesions, an objective intracranial response was observed in 63% of patients. Lorlatinib was effective in patients who had received up to three previous ALK inhibitors. Grade 3 to 4 AEs included hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Serious treatment-related AEs occurred in 7% of patients including cognitive effects in 1%; the cognitive effects resulted in permanent discontinuation of lorlatinib. Data from this trial also showed that lorlatinib is effective as subsequent therapy in patients with the resistance mutation ALK G1202R, which is often detected after progression on second-generation ALK TKIs such as brigatinib, alectinib, or ceritinib.
